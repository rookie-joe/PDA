Given a $ Model Instructions containing task instructions and few-shot prompt for a student model, then the $ Model Output, your task is to act as a teacher and verify whether the model output in the "# Problem:" field fulfills its instructions for translating the formal statement.
In your response, give your feedback by deciding between ACCEPT or REJECT, based on wehether the model output for the "# Problem:" field is correctly translated.
If your feedback is ACCEPT, put NONE in your explanations; if your feedback is REJECT, you need to explain why the natural-language statement in model output is not semantically aligned with the formal theorem statement in Lean 4.
Note that common math operations written in symbols can be considered as natural language, as long as they are not exclusively defined in Lean 4, so it is acceptable if model output contains them.
You only need to verify the model output in the "# Problem:" field.

Given a statement and its proof written in Lean 4’s syntax, please translate them into the semantically equivalent natural language that a human reader can independently understand without knowing any concepts in lean 4. The translation should accurately convey the same logical structure and content as the original statement and proof.
You need to explain the theorem and proof in the most intuitive terms possible, but also maintain the fidelity of the original mathematical reasoning. To do so, first translate the theorem statement into a natural language problem so that it does not contain any function in lean 4 (write after "# Problem:"). 
Then for the proof, you can explain each step of the proof in natural language based on the meaning of the lemma or tactic that is used (write after "# Explanation:"). Lastly and most importantly, write the step-by-step proof for the problem in natural language without mentioning verbatim any function in lean 4 (write after "# Proof:").

Follow the format below.
# Theorem: (theorem and proof in lean 4, to be translated)
# Problem: (theorem in natural language)
# Explanation: (proof in natural language, explaining the functions in lean 4)
# Proof: (proof in natural language, understandable by any human reader without the knowledge of lean 4 functions)

Here are some translation examples:

# Theorem: theorem eq_zero_iff_even {n : \u2115} : (n : ZMod 2) = 0 \u2194 Even n :=\n (CharP.cast_eq_zero_iff (ZMod 2) 2 n).trans even_iff_two_dvd.symm\n
# Problem: Prove that for any natural number n, n is even if and only if n is congruent to 0 modulo 2.
# Explanation: The proof uses the following chain of reasoning:\n1. `CharP.cast_eq_zero_iff (ZMod 2) 2 n`: This lemma states that for any natural number n, n is congruent to 0 modulo 2 if and only if the remainder when n is divided by 2 is 0.\n2. `even_iff_two_dvd.symm`: This lemma states that a number is even if and only if it is divisible by 2.\n3. `.trans`: This tactic combines the two lemmas by showing that if n is congruent to 0 modulo 2, then the remainder when n is divided by 2 is 0, and therefore n is divisible by 2, which means n is even.
# Proof: We need to prove both directions of the \"if and only if\" statement.\n\n**Direction 1: If n is even, then n is congruent to 0 modulo 2.**\nIf n is even, then by definition, n is divisible by 2. This means that the remainder when n is divided by 2 is 0.  Therefore, n is congruent to 0 modulo 2.\n\n**Direction 2: If n is congruent to 0 modulo 2, then n is even.**\nIf n is congruent to 0 modulo 2, then the remainder when n is divided by 2 is 0. This implies that n is divisible by 2. Hence, n is even.\n\nSince we have proven both directions, we have shown that a natural number n is even if and only if n is congruent to 0 modulo 2.

# Theorem: theorem forall_mem_comm {α β} [Membership α β] {s : β} {p : α → α → Prop} :\n    (∀ a (_ : a ∈ s) b (_ : b ∈ s), p a b) ↔ ∀ a b, a ∈ s → b ∈ s → p a b :=\n  forall_cond_comm
# Problem: Prove that for any set \( s \), a property \( p \) holds for all elements \( a \) and \( b \) in \( s \) if and only if, for every pair of elements \( a \) and \( b \) in the set \( s \), the property \( p \) holds between them.
# Explanation:  
1. The original statement involves checking whether a property \( p \) holds for elements \( a \) and \( b \) in a set \( s \).
2. The left-hand side of the equivalence states that for every \( a \) in \( s \), for every \( b \) in \( s \), the property \( p(a, b) \) holds.
3. The right-hand side of the equivalence restates this, but in a more traditional way, using implications. It says that for every \( a \) and \( b \), if \( a \in s \) and \( b \in s \), then \( p(a, b) \) holds.
4. The tactic `forall_cond_comm` helps translate between these two forms, essentially commuting the logical structure of the quantifiers and conditions.
# Proof:  
We need to show that these two forms are logically equivalent.
1. **First direction (left to right)**:  
   Suppose we are given that for all elements \( a \in s \), for all \( b \in s \), the property \( p(a, b) \) holds. This directly means that, for any \( a \) and \( b \), if both \( a \) and \( b \) are in the set \( s \), then \( p(a, b) \) is true. Therefore, if \( a \in s \) and \( b \in s \), we know that \( p(a, b) \) holds by the original assumption.
2. **Second direction (right to left)**:  
   Now assume that for every pair of elements \( a \) and \( b \), if \( a \in s \) and \( b \in s \), then \( p(a, b) \) holds. This means that for any \( a \in s \), we can take any \( b \in s \), and the property \( p(a, b) \) must hold. Thus, the condition on \( p \) is satisfied for all such pairs within \( s \).
Since both directions of the equivalence are proven, the two forms of the statement are logically equivalent. Therefore, the property \( p \) holds for all pairs of elements in the set \( s \) if and only if, for each \( a \in s \) and \( b \in s \), the property \( p(a, b) \) holds.

# Problem: Prove that the square of any natural number is greater than 0.
# Explanation: The proof uses the following steps:\n1. `a1`: This refers to the fact that `a` is greater than 0, which is a premise of the theorem.\n2. `le_of_lt a1`: This lemma states that if `a` is greater than 0, then 0 is less than or equal to `a`.\n3. `Nat.mul_le_mul_left 1 a a (le_of_lt a1)`: This lemma states that if 1 is less than or equal to `a` (which is true because `a` is a natural number and greater than 0), and 0 is less than or equal to `a` (from step 2), then 1 multiplied by `a` is less than or equal to `a` multiplied by `a`.\n4. `rwa [mul_one] at this`: This tactic rewrites the goal using the lemma `mul_one`, which states that 1 multiplied by any number is equal to that number. This simplifies the goal from `1 * a ≤ a * a` to `a ≤ a * a`.\n5. `le_trans`: This tactic combines the inequality `0 ≤ a` (from step 2) with the inequality `a ≤ a * a` (from step 4) to conclude that `0 < a * a`.
# Proof: 1. We know that 'a' is a natural number greater than 0.\n2. Since 'a' is greater than 0, we can say that 0 is less than or equal to 'a'.\n3. We can also say that 1 is less than or equal to 'a' because 'a' is a natural number and greater than 0.\n4. Multiplying both sides of the inequality '0 ≤ a' by 'a', we get '0 * a ≤ a * a'.\n5. Since multiplying any number by 0 results in 0, the inequality becomes '0 ≤ a * a'.\n6. We also know that multiplying any number by 1 doesn't change its value, so '1 * a' is the same as 'a'.\n7. Combining this with the fact that '1 ≤ a', we get 'a ≤ a * a'.\n8. Since 0 is less than or equal to 'a' and 'a' is less than or equal to 'a * a', we can conclude that 0 is strictly less than 'a * a'.\n9. Therefore, the square of any natural number is greater than 0.

# Theorem: theorem SymmetricRel.eq {U : Set (\u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b1)} (hU : SymmetricRel U) : Prod.swap \u207b\u00b9' U = U :=\n   hU\n \n# Problem: Prove that for a symmetric relation U on a set, reversing the order of elements in every pair within the relation results in the same relation. \n# Explanation:\n1. `U : Set (\u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b1)`: This indicates that `U` is a set of pairs, where each pair consists of two elements from a set `\u03b1`. In other words, `U` represents a relation on the set `\u03b1`.\n2. `SymmetricRel U`: This states that `U` is a symmetric relation, meaning if the pair `(a, b)` is in `U`, then the pair `(b, a)` is also in `U`.\n3. `Prod.swap \u207b\u00b9' U`: This represents the inverse image of the set `U` under the function `Prod.swap`. `Prod.swap` is a function that takes a pair `(a, b)` and returns the reversed pair `(b, a)`. The inverse image of `U` under `Prod.swap` is the set of all pairs `(a, b)` such that `(b, a)` is in `U`.\n4. `= U`: The theorem aims to prove that the inverse image of `U` under `Prod.swap` is equal to `U` itself.\n5. `hU`: This refers to the assumption that `U` is a symmetric relation.\n# Proof:\nTo show that reversing the pairs in the relation `U` results in the same relation, we need to demonstrate that any pair in the reversed relation is also in the original relation, and vice versa.\n\n1. **Any pair in the reversed relation is also in the original relation:**  Consider a pair `(a, b)` that belongs to the reversed relation, meaning `(b, a)` is in the original relation `U`. Since `U` is symmetric, if `(b, a)` is in `U`, then `(a, b)` must also be in `U`. Therefore, any pair in the reversed relation is also present in the original relation.\n\n2. **Any pair in the original relation is also in the reversed relation:** Consider a pair `(a, b)` in the original relation `U`. Due to the symmetric property of `U`, the pair `(b, a)` must also be in `U`. This implies that `(a, b)` belongs to the reversed relation as well. \n\nSince we have shown both directions - that any pair in the reversed relation is in the original relation, and any pair in the original relation is in the reversed relation - we can conclude that reversing the order of elements in every pair within the symmetric relation `U` results in the same relation.\n

# Theorem: theorem le_jacobson : I \u2264 jacobson I := fun _ hx => mem_sInf.mpr fun _ hJ => hJ.left hx\n \n# Problem: Prove that for any ideal I in a commutative ring, I is a subset of its Jacobson radical, denoted as jacobson I. \n# Explanation: \n1. `I \u2264 jacobson I`: This states that the ideal I is a subset of its Jacobson radical. \n2. `fun _ hx => ...`: This starts the proof by assuming we have an arbitrary element (represented by `_`) and that this element belongs to the ideal I (represented by `hx`).\n3. `mem_sInf.mpr`: This lemma helps prove a statement about the intersection of sets. In this context, the Jacobson radical is defined as the intersection of all maximal ideals containing I. This step aims to show that if an element belongs to I, it belongs to this intersection.\n4. `fun _ hJ => ...`: It assumes we have a maximal ideal (represented by `_`) satisfying the property of containing I (represented by `hJ`). \n5. `hJ.left hx`: This likely refers to using the property `hJ` (the maximal ideal contains I) along with the fact `hx` (the element belongs to I) to conclude something.\n# Proof: \n1. We need to show that any element in the ideal I is also an element of the Jacobson radical of I.\n2. Consider an arbitrary element 'x' in the ideal I. \n3. By definition, the Jacobson radical of I is the intersection of all maximal ideals that contain I. \n4. To prove 'x' is in the Jacobson radical, we need to show that 'x' belongs to every maximal ideal containing I.\n5. Let's consider any maximal ideal, denoted as M, that contains I.\n6. Since M contains I, and 'x' is an element of I, it follows that 'x' must also be an element of M.\n7. As we chose M arbitrarily, this logic applies to all maximal ideals containing I. \n8. Therefore, 'x' belongs to every maximal ideal containing I, and hence 'x' belongs to the Jacobson radical of I. \n9. Since 'x' was an arbitrary element of I, this holds for all elements in I. \n10. Therefore, we have proved that I is a subset of its Jacobson radical (I \u2264 jacobson I). \n

We're splitting the problem into cases based on this condition, represented by `h`.\n4. `h.1.symm.sup_sdiff_cancel_right`: This likely refers to a specific property or rule about sets or sequences. It suggests that if the condition `h` is true, then removing and reinserting the element `a` has a neutralizing effect due to some underlying structure.\n5. `rfl`: This stands for \"reflexivity\" and is used when the proof in a particular case is immediately obvious. If the condition `h` is not true, the proof might be trivial.\n# Proof: \nLet's break down why this compression operation always results in the original sequence:\n\n1. **Understanding \"Compression\":**  Imagine the compression process as having two steps: First, we go through the sequence and remove all instances of the element `a`. Then, we go back and reinsert each removed `a` back into its original position in the sequence.\n\n2. **Casework:** The proof seems to consider two possibilities based on the condition 'h', which likely relates to whether the element `a` exists in the sequence:\n\n    * **Case 1: `a` is present in the sequence.** In this case, removing all `a`s and then putting them back in the exact same positions will obviously result in the original sequence. It's like taking something apart and putting it back together perfectly. The rule `h.1.symm.sup_sdiff_cancel_right` likely formalizes why these actions cancel out in the context of sequences.\n\n    * **Case 2: `a` is not present in the sequence.** If the element `a` doesn't exist in the sequence to begin with, the compression process doesn't actually change anything. We're removing and reinserting something that wasn't there in the first place. Hence, the result is trivially the same as the original sequence. This is why the proof uses `rfl` (reflexivity) for this case.\n\n**In Conclusion:** Whether or not the element `a` exists in the original sequence, the act of \"compressing\" the sequence by removing and reinserting `a` always leads back to the initial sequence. \n

$ Feedback Explanation: The formal theorem `compress_self (u a : α) : compress u u a = a` states that compressing the element `u` with respect to itself and another element `a` results in `a`. The given problem statement incorrectly describes a sequence operation, which is not what the formal theorem conveys. The formal theorem is about a specific function `compress` acting on elements, not about a sequence or list operation.

In other words, the tangent function repeats its values in intervals of \u03c0.\n2. `.sub_eq x`: This applies the periodic property with subtraction, stating that for any number 'x', `tan(x - \u03c0)` is equal to `tan(x)`.\n# Proof: \n1. We know that the tangent function is periodic with period \u03c0. This means that the tangent function repeats its values every \u03c0 units along the x-axis.\n2. Therefore, subtracting \u03c0 from the input of the tangent function doesn't change the output value.\n3.
