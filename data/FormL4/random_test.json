This includes all points close to 'a' but excludes 'a' itself.\n3. `pure a`: Represents the set containing only the element 'a'.\n4. `\u2294`: This symbol denotes the union of two sets.\nThe proof strategically rewrites both sides of the equation using these definitions and lemmas:\n   - `nhdsWithin_singleton`: This lemma connects the neighborhood of a point within a singleton set (a set with only one element) to the 'pure' set containing that element.\n   - `nhdsWithin_union`: This lemma relates the neighborhood of a point within a union of sets to the neighborhoods within the individual sets.\n   - `compl_union_self`: This lemma states that the union of a set and its complement is the entire universal set.\n   - `nhdsWithin_univ`: This lemma states that the neighborhood of a point within the entire universal set is simply the neighborhood of that point.",
        "nl_proof": "1. **Start with the right-hand side:** We begin with the neighborhood of 'a', denoted as '\ud835\udcdd a'.\n2. **Rewrite using the universal set:** We can express this neighborhood as the neighborhood of 'a' within the universal set, which doesn't change its meaning: '\ud835\udcdd a = \ud835\udcdd[univ] a'.\n3. **Introduce the complement:**  We can then rewrite the universal set as the union of the singleton set '{a}' and its complement: '\ud835\udcdd[univ] a = \ud835\udcdd[{a} \u222a {a}\u1d9c] a'.\n4. **Apply nhdsWithin_union:**  This allows us to express the neighborhood within the union as a union of neighborhoods: '\ud835\udcdd[{a} \u222a {a}\u1d9c] a = \ud835\udcdd[{a}] a \u222a \ud835\udcdd[{a}\u1d9c] a'.\n5. **Simplify using nhdsWithin_singleton:** The neighborhood within the singleton set '{a}' is simply the set '{a}' itself: '\ud835\udcdd[{a}] a \u222a \ud835\udcdd[{a}\u1d9c] a = {a} \u222a \ud835\udcdd[{a}\u1d9c] a'.\n6. **Recognize the punctured neighborhood:** The neighborhood of 'a' within the complement of '{a}' is precisely the punctured neighborhood of 'a': '{a} \u222a \ud835\udcdd[{a}\u1d9c] a = {a} \u222a \ud835\udcdd[\u2260] a'.\n7. **Rearrange using commutativity of union:** We can swap the order of the union: '{a} \u222a \ud835\udcdd[\u2260] a = \ud835\udcdd[\u2260] a \u222a {a}'.\n8. **Rewrite using 'pure':** Finally, we replace '{a}' with 'pure a': '\ud835\udcdd[\u2260] a \u222a {a} = \ud835\udcdd[\u2260] a \u2294 pure a'.\n\nThis sequence of steps demonstrates that '\ud835\udcdd a = \ud835\udcdd[\u2260] a \u2294 pure a', proving the theorem."

Elements of this product are pairs (n, g) where n is from N and g is from G.\n2. **'map' function:** The 'map' function takes the homomorphisms f\u2081, f\u2082, and a function h to create a new homomorphism between the semidirect products N \u22ca[\u03c6] G and N' \u22ca[\u03c6'] G'.\n3. **'right' component:**  In the context of semidirect products, the 'right' component of an element (n, g) simply refers to the 'g' part, which comes from the group G.\n4. **`rfl` tactic:** This tactic in Lean is used when the left and right sides of an equality are equal by definition.",
        "nl_proof": "1. Let's start with an element 'g' from the semidirect product N \u22ca[\u03c6] G. We can express 'g' as a pair (n, g') where n belongs to N and g' belongs to G.\n2. Applying the 'map' function to 'g' using f\u2081, f\u2082, and h gives us (map f\u2081 f\u2082 h g) which, due to the way 'map' is defined for semidirect products, results in the pair (f\u2081 (...), f\u2082 g').  The specific value within the first component (represented by '...')  isn't important for this proof.\n3. Now, if we extract the 'right' component of this result, we get f\u2082 g'.\n4. On the other hand, if we first take the 'right' component of the original element 'g' = (n, g'), we get g'.\n5. Applying f\u2082 to this gives us f\u2082 g'.\n6. As we can see, both sides of the equation result in f\u2082 g'. Therefore, the statement holds true by definition."

We need to show that (m + 0) \u2022 a = (m \u2022 a) + (0 \u2022 a).  Since adding 0 to any number doesn't change the number, we can simplify this to m \u2022 a = (m \u2022 a) + (0 \u2022 a). Now, multiplying any element 'a' by 0 is like adding 'a' to itself zero times, which results in the neutral element of addition (like '0' in usual addition). So, the right side becomes (m \u2022 a) plus the neutral element, which is simply (m \u2022 a).

Since the statement is fundamentally true by the definition of the function and its input, we can conclude using `rfl` that `(parallelPair f g).obj zero = X`."

The first part \"...\" will prove the \"forward\" direction (left to right), and the second \"...\" proves the \"reverse\" direction (right to left).\n\n5. **`fun \u27e8a, ae\u27e9 => ...`**: This starts the proof of the forward direction. It assumes there exists an integer `a` such that `m * a = n` (this is what `ae` represents, the proof of `a`'s existence and its property). We then need to show that `m` divides `n` as natural numbers.\n\n6. **`m.eq_zero_or_pos.elim ...`**: This breaks down the proof into two cases based on whether `m` is zero or positive, as natural numbers have this property.\n\n   - **Case 1: `m = 0`**: If `m` is zero, the proof simplifies significantly, and Lean handles this case automatically.\n\n   - **Case 2: `m > 0`**: This case is more involved and requires further analysis. It leverages the fact that the product of a positive number with another number being non-negative implies that the other number is also non-negative.\n\n7. **`fun \u27e8k, e\u27e9 => ...`**: This starts the proof of the reverse direction. It assumes there exists a natural number `k` such that `m * k = n` (represented by `e`). We then need to show that `m` as an integer divides `n` as an integer.\n\n8. **`Dvd.intro k ...`**: This introduces `k` as the witness for the divisibility relationship in the integers.\n\n9. **`rw [e, Int.ofNat_mul]`**: This rewrites the goal using the fact that multiplication of natural numbers is equivalent to multiplication of their integer counterparts.\n\n# Proof:\n**Forward Direction:** If *m* as an integer divides *n* as an integer, then *m* divides *n* as natural numbers.\n\n1. Assume *m* as an integer divides *n* as an integer. This means there exists an integer *a* such that *m* * *a* = *n*.\n\n2. We consider two cases:\n    - **Case 1: *m* = 0**. If *m* is zero, then *m* divides *n* by definition (zero divides every number).\n    - **Case 2: *m* > 0**. If *m* is positive, and since the product of a positive number and another number being non-negative implies the other number is also non-negative, *a* must be a non-negative integer.  Since *m* and *a* are both non-negative, they can be treated as natural numbers. Therefore, *m* divides *n* in the realm of natural numbers.\n\n**Reverse Direction:** If *m* divides *n* as natural numbers, then *m* as an integer divides *n* as an integer.\n\n1. Assume *m* divides *n* as natural numbers. This means there exists a natural number *k* such that *m* * *k* = *n*.\n\n2. Since multiplication of natural numbers has the same result as multiplication of their corresponding integers, we can say that *m* as an integer multiplied by *k* as an integer equals *n* as an integer. \n\n3. Therefore, *m* as an integer divides *n* as an integer.\n\nIn conclusion, we have proven that for any two natural numbers *m* and *n*, *m* divides *n* if and only if *m* as an integer divides *n* as an integer. This demonstrates the consistency of divisibility between these two number systems. \n",

The \"\u2191\" symbol denotes casting a natural number to an integer. \n    - **`m \u2223 n`**: This simply means *m* divides *n* in the realm of natural numbers.\n\n4. **`\u27e8... , ...\u27e9`**: This structure in Lean is used to construct proofs for \"if and only if\" statements. The first part \"...\" will prove the \"forward\" direction (left to right), and the second \"...\" proves the \"reverse\" direction (right to left).\n\n5. **`fun \u27e8a, ae\u27e9 => ...`**: This starts the proof of the forward direction. It assumes there exists an integer `a` such that `m * a = n` (this is what `ae` represents, the proof of `a`'s existence and its property). We then need to show that `m` divides `n` as natural numbers.\n\n6. **`m.eq_zero_or_pos.elim ...`**: This breaks down the proof into two cases based on whether `m` is zero or positive, as natural numbers have this property.\n\n   - **Case 1: `m = 0`**: If `m` is zero, the proof simplifies significantly, and Lean handles this case automatically.\n\n   - **Case 2: `m > 0`**: This case is more involved and requires further analysis. It leverages the fact that the product of a positive number with another number being non-negative implies that the other number is also non-negative.\n\n7. **`fun \u27e8k, e\u27e9 => ...`**: This starts the proof of the reverse direction. It assumes there exists a natural number `k` such that `m * k = n` (represented by `e`). We then need to show that `m` as an integer divides `n` as an integer.\n\n8. **`Dvd.intro k ...`**: This introduces `k` as the witness for the divisibility relationship in the integers.\n\n9. **`rw [e, Int.ofNat_mul]`**: This rewrites the goal using the fact that multiplication of natural numbers is equivalent to multiplication of their integer counterparts.",
        "nl_proof": "**Forward Direction:** If *m* as an integer divides *n* as an integer, then *m* divides *n* as natural numbers.\n\n1. Assume *m* as an integer divides *n* as an integer. This means there exists an integer *a* such that *m* * *a* = *n*.\n\n2. We consider two cases:\n    - **Case 1: *m* = 0**. If *m* is zero, then *m* divides *n* by definition (zero divides every number).\n    - **Case 2: *m* > 0**. If *m* is positive, and since the product of a positive number and another number being non-negative implies the other number is also non-negative, *a* must be a non-negative integer.  Since *m* and *a* are both non-negative, they can be treated as natural numbers. Therefore, *m* divides *n* in the realm of natural numbers.\n\n**Reverse Direction:** If *m* divides *n* as natural numbers, then *m* as an integer divides *n* as an integer.\n\n1. Assume *m* divides *n* as natural numbers. This means there exists a natural number *k* such that *m* * *k* = *n*.\n\n2. Since multiplication of natural numbers has the same result as multiplication of their corresponding integers, we can say that *m* as an integer multiplied by *k* as an integer equals *n* as an integer. \n\n3. Therefore, *m* as an integer divides *n* as an integer.\n\nIn conclusion, we have proven that for any two natural numbers *m* and *n*, *m* divides *n* if and only if *m* as an integer divides *n* as an integer. This demonstrates the consistency of divisibility between these two number systems."

Here's a breakdown:\n1. **log_mul_base**: This is the name of the theorem we're trying to prove. It takes two natural numbers, 'b' and 'n', as input, along with the conditions that 'b' is greater than 1 and 'n' is not equal to 0.\n2. **hb: 1 < b**: This is a condition stating that 'b' (the base of the logarithm) is strictly greater than 1.\n3. **hn: n \u2260 0**: This condition ensures that 'n' is not equal to 0.\n4. **log b (n * b) = log b n + 1**: This is the statement we aim to prove: the logarithm of (n*b) to the base 'b' is equal to the logarithm of 'n' to the base 'b', plus 1.\n5. **log_eq_of_pow_le_of_lt_pow**: This lemma helps prove the equality of logarithms by showing that the arguments of the logarithms (in this case, 'n*b' and 'n*b') satisfy certain inequalities when raised to the power of 'b'.\n6. **pow_succ', Nat.mul_comm b**: These rewrite the expressions involving powers and multiplication to simplify the inequalities.\n7. **Nat.mul_le_mul_right, pow_log_le_self, Nat.mul_lt_mul_right, Nat.zero_lt_one.trans hb, lt_pow_succ_log_self**: These are lemmas used to prove the necessary inequalities for applying 'log_eq_of_pow_le_of_lt_pow'. They deal with properties of multiplication, powers, and logarithms.\n\n# Proof: To prove the theorem, we need to show that both sides of the equation are equivalent. We'll use the properties of logarithms and exponents.\n\n1. **Understanding Logarithms:** Recall that the equation \\(log_b a = c\\) is equivalent to \\(b^c = a\\). We will use this property to manipulate our expressions.\n\n2. **Let's analyze the left side of the equation:  log b (n * b)** \n   - Let's assume \\(log_b (n * b) = x\\). This means, by the definition of logarithms, that \\(b^x = n * b\\).\n\n3. **Now, let's look at the right side of the equation: log b n + 1**\n   - Let's assume \\(log_b n = y\\). This means \\(b^y = n\\).\n   - Therefore, the right side becomes \\(y + 1\\).\n\n4. **Relating both sides:**  \n   - We know \\(b^x = n * b\\) and \\(b^y = n\\). \n   - Notice that we can rewrite \\(b^x = n * b\\) as \\(b^x = b^y * b\\), since \\(n = b^y\\).\n   - Using the properties of exponents, \\(b^x = b^y * b\\) can be simplified to \\(b^x = b^(y+1)\\).\n   - Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents: \\(x = y + 1\\).\n\n5. **Final step:**\n   - Recall that we assumed \\(log_b (n * b) = x\\) and \\(log_b n = y\\).\n   - We have shown that \\(x = y + 1\\).\n   - Substituting back, we get \\(log_b (n * b) = log_b n + 1\\).\n\nTherefore, we have proven that for any natural numbers \\(b\\) and \\(n\\) where \\(b\\) is greater than 1 and \\(n\\) is not 0, the logarithm base \\(b\\) of ( \\(n\\) multiplied by \\(b\\)) is equal to the logarithm base \\(b\\) of \\(n\\) plus 1.

We will use this property to manipulate our expressions.\n\n2. **Let's analyze the left side of the equation:  log b (n * b)** \n   - Let's assume \\(log_b (n * b) = x\\).

Imagine aligning a coordinate system with a specific direction.\n* `toBasis`: This function extracts the basis information from an orientation. It's like looking at the coordinate axes of an oriented object.\n* `orientation`: This function retrieves the orientation component from a basis. It tells us how the basis is oriented in space.\n\nThe proof proceeds by rewriting the expression and then applying a known property.\n1. `rw [e.toBasis_adjustToOrientation]`: This step rewrites the expression using a lemma (a proven fact). The lemma `e.toBasis_adjustToOrientation` likely states a relationship between adjusting an orientation to a basis and then extracting the basis. \n2. `exact e.toBasis.orientation_adjustToOrientation x`: This step directly applies another lemma, `e.toBasis.orientation_adjustToOrientation x`. This lemma likely encapsulates the core idea of the theorem\u2014that adjusting an orientation to a basis and then retrieving the orientation from the adjusted basis results in the original orientation.",
        "nl_proof": "1. Let's start with an orientation 'x' and a basis 'e'.\n2. We first adjust the orientation 'x' to the basis 'e' using the `adjustToOrientation` function.\n3. We then extract the basis from this adjusted orientation using the `toBasis` function.\n4. Now, we are interested in the orientation of this extracted basis. We obtain this orientation using the `orientation` function.\n5. The theorem states that this final orientation is equal to our original orientation 'x'.\n6. This claim is proven by relying on previously established facts about how adjusting to a basis and extracting orientations interact, as encapsulated in the lemmas used in the Lean proof.\n7. Therefore, we have shown that adjusting an orientation to a basis and then extracting the orientation from the resulting basis gives us back the initial orientation."

As \\( \\frac{1}{p} * p \\) simplifies to 1, we get \\( r * p < 1 \\). \n\n**Direction 2: If \\( r * p < 1 \\), then \\( r < \\frac{1}{p} \\).**\n\n1. We begin with the assumption that \\( r * p < 1 \\). \n2. Since \\( p \\) is positive, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by the inverse of  \\( p \\) (which also exists as  \\( p \\) is not zero) without changing the inequality direction:  \\( (r * p) * \\frac{1}{p} < 1 * \\frac{1}{p} \\).\n3. Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rearrange the left side: \\( r * (p * \\frac{1}{p}) < 1 * \\frac{1}{p} \\).\n4. Simplifying, we get \\( r * 1 < \\frac{1}{p} \\), which is equivalent to \\( r < \\frac{1}{p} \\).\n\nSince we have proven both directions of the equivalence, the theorem holds: for any non-negative real numbers \\( r \\) and \\( p \\) where \\( p \\) is not zero, \\( r \\) is less than the inverse of \\( p \\) if and only if the product of \\( r \\) and \\( p \\) is less than 1."

So, `(f / g).NeBot` means the function `f / g` never approaches negative infinity. \n2. We want to prove that if `(f / g).NeBot` is true, then `f.NeBot` must also be true.\n3. We use the lemma `NeBot.of_map\u2082_left`. This lemma helps us reason about functions that are constructed by applying an operation to other functions. In this case, the division operation (`/`) combines `f` and `g`. The lemma essentially states that if the result of applying a specific operation (like division) to two functions never approaches negative infinity, then the left operand (`f` in this case) must also never approach negative infinity.\n\n# Proof:\n1. We are given that the quotient `f / g` never approaches negative infinity.\n2. Consider what it would take for `f` to approach negative infinity while `f / g` does not. This would require the denominator, `g`, to simultaneously approach negative infinity at a faster rate than `f`.\n3. However, if `g` approaches negative infinity faster than `f`, their quotient `f / g` would not remain finite; it would also approach negative infinity.\n4. This contradicts our initial assumption that `f / g` never approaches negative infinity. \n5. Therefore, our assumption that `f` can approach negative infinity while `f / g` does not must be false.\n6. Hence, if `f / g` never approaches negative infinity, then `f` itself must also never approach negative infinity. This proves the theorem. \n",

So, `(f / g).NeBot` means the function `f / g` never approaches negative infinity. \n2. We want to prove that if `(f / g).NeBot` is true, then `f.NeBot` must also be true.\n3. We use the lemma `NeBot.of_map\u2082_left`. This lemma helps us reason about functions that are constructed by applying an operation to other functions. In this case, the division operation (`/`) combines `f` and `g`. The lemma essentially states that if the result of applying a specific operation (like division) to two functions never approaches negative infinity, then the left operand (`f` in this case) must also never approach negative infinity.",
        "nl_proof": "1. We are given that the quotient `f / g` never approaches negative infinity.\n2. Consider what it would take for `f` to approach negative infinity while `f / g` does not. This would require the denominator, `g`, to simultaneously approach negative infinity at a faster rate than `f`.\n3. However, if `g` approaches negative infinity faster than `f`, their quotient `f / g` would not remain finite; it would also approach negative infinity.\n4. This contradicts our initial assumption that `f / g` never approaches negative infinity. \n5. Therefore, our assumption that `f` can approach negative infinity while `f / g` does not must be false.\n6. Hence, if `f / g` never approaches negative infinity, then `f` itself must also never approach negative infinity. This proves the theorem."

In this case, applying `powersetAux'` to both should still result in permutations (likely both empty).\n2. **Inductive Steps**: The proof considers different ways permutations can be constructed (e.g., adding an element to the front, swapping elements). For each case, it leverages the inductive hypothesis (assuming the property holds for smaller permutations) and properties of `powersetAux'` to demonstrate that the resulting lists remain permutations.\n\n# Proof:\nWe will prove this by induction on the structure of the permutation `p`.\n\n**Base Case:** If `p` represents an empty permutation (both lists are empty), then applying `powersetAux'` to both lists will result in two lists that are also permutations of each other.

Since the overall change in \u03a6's output is simply the combined change of its components, and each component changes smoothly, the overall change in \u03a6 can also be well-approximated by a linear transformation.  Therefore,  \u03a6 is differentiable at x. \n\nBecause we've proven both directions, we've shown that \u03a6 is differentiable at a point x if and only if each of its component functions is differentiable at x."

We start with the expression \u27ea0, x\u27eb, where 0 is the zero vector and x is any vector.\n2. We can rewrite the zero vector 0 as 0 * 0, where the first 0 is the zero element in the scalar field K, and the second 0 is the zero vector in E.

A uniform embedding is a function between metric spaces that preserves the distance between points, even when those points are considered within different subsets of the spaces.\n\n# Explanation: This theorem states that the function `Sum.inr` is a uniform embedding. \n1. `Sum.inr` is a function that takes an element of type `\u03b2` and injects it into the \"right\" side of the sum type `\u03b1 \u2295 \u03b2`. A sum type represents a value that can be one of two types, either `\u03b1` or `\u03b2`.

A function is a uniform embedding if it preserves the distance between any two points, even when those points are considered as part of different subsets.\n3. The proof uses the lemma `uniformEmbedding_iff'`, which provides an alternative way to prove that a function is a uniform embedding. We use the second part of this equivalence (`2`), hence `uniformEmbedding_iff'.2`.\n4. To use `uniformEmbedding_iff'.2`, we need to show three things:\n   - `Sum.inr_injective`: This lemma states that `Sum.inr` is an injective function, meaning that it maps distinct elements of `\u03b2` to distinct elements of `\u03b1 \u2295 \u03b2`.\n   - `uniformContinuous_inr`: This lemma states that `Sum.inr` is a uniformly continuous function, meaning that for any given distance threshold, we can find a corresponding distance threshold in the input space such that any two points within that input threshold are mapped to points within the output threshold.\n   - The third part is a function that takes a subset `s` of `\u03b2` and its proof of being a uniform space (`hs`) and constructs a subset of `\u03b1 \u2295 \u03b2` that satisfies the conditions of a uniform embedding. This construction involves creating a set that includes the image of `s` under `Sum.inr` and ensuring it has the necessary properties.\n\n# Proof:  To prove that `Sum.inr` is a uniform embedding, we will show that it satisfies the conditions of `uniformEmbedding_iff'.2`:\n\n1. **`Sum.inr` is injective**: This is true because `Sum.inr` maps different elements of `\u03b2` to different elements of `\u03b1 \u2295 \u03b2`. If we have two distinct elements `b1` and `b2` in `\u03b2`, then `Sum.inr b1` and `Sum.inr b2` will be distinct elements in `\u03b1 \u2295 \u03b2` because they represent different \"injections\" into the sum type.\n\n2. **`Sum.inr` is uniformly continuous**:  This is true because the distance between points in the \"right\" side of the sum type `\u03b1 \u2295 \u03b2` is determined solely by the distance between the corresponding points in `\u03b2`. Since we are not changing the distance between points when we inject them into the sum type, `Sum.inr` preserves distances and is therefore uniformly continuous.\n\n3. **Constructing the appropriate subset**:  Given a subset `s` of `\u03b2` that is a uniform space (meaning it has a well-defined notion of distance), we can construct a corresponding subset in `\u03b1 \u2295 \u03b2` that satisfies the conditions of a uniform embedding. This subset is created by taking all the elements in `s`, applying `Sum.inr` to them, and including them in the subset. This ensures that the distances between points in `s` are preserved when they are mapped to `\u03b1 \u2295 \u03b2` by `Sum.inr`.\n\nTherefore, since `Sum.inr` is injective, uniformly continuous, and we can construct appropriate subsets, it satisfies the conditions of `uniformEmbedding_iff'.2` and is therefore a uniform embedding.\n",

This line expresses that this related neighborhood system is also countably generated, which we derive from our assumption.\n4. `rw [OnePoint.comap_coe_nhds_infty, coclosedCompact_eq_cocompact] at this`: We then use properties of the one-point compactification and how open sets relate between the rationals and their compactification to rewrite our derived statement. Essentially, we show that if our assumption holds, then the set of co-closed compact sets in the rationals would also be countably generated.\n5. `not_countably_generated_cocompact this`: Finally, we reach a contradiction. We have a theorem (`not_countably_generated_cocompact`) that states the set of co-closed compact sets in the rationals is *not* countably generated. This contradicts our derived statement, meaning our initial assumption was incorrect.\n# Proof:\n1. Let's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the neighborhood system of infinity in the extended rational numbers is countably generated.\n2. This means we could find a countable collection of open sets around infinity that would \"generate\" all other open neighborhoods of infinity through unions and intersections.\n3. Now, consider the rational numbers embedded within their one-point compactification \u2013 essentially, the rationals with infinity added. \n4. Our assumption about the neighborhood system of infinity would imply that the collection of sets in the rationals whose complements are closed and compact is also countably generated. This is due to a correspondence between open sets around infinity and these specific types of sets in the rationals.\n5. However, we know that the collection of sets in the rationals with closed and compact complements is *not* countably generated.

Prove that if the fuel limit `k\u2081` is less than or equal to another fuel limit `k\u2082`, and a value `x` is a possible output of `evaln` with fuel limit `k\u2081`, then `x` is also a possible output of `evaln` with fuel limit `k\u2082`. In simpler words, increasing the fuel limit of a computation can only produce more possible output values, not fewer.\n# Explanation: This theorem describes a monotonicity property of the `evaln` function with respect to its fuel limit parameter.  The proof proceeds by induction on the structure of the command `c`, showing that for each possible command constructor, the property holds. The `evaln` function likely represents a computation with a limited number of steps, and the fuel limit `k` restricts how many steps can be taken.\n# Proof: We will prove this by induction on the structure of the command `c`. \n\n**Base Case:** If the command `c` is empty, then `evaln` will produce the same set of output values regardless of the fuel limit. Therefore, the property holds.\n\n**Inductive Step:** We need to consider each possible constructor for the command `c`:\n\n* **Pair:** If `c` is a pair of commands `cf` and `cg`, then `evaln` will execute both sub-commands sequentially.  By the inductive hypothesis, if `x` is a possible output of `evaln` with fuel limit `k\u2081` for either sub-command, it is also a possible output with fuel limit `k\u2082`. Therefore, the property holds for the pair command.\n\n* **Composition:** If `c` is a composition of commands `cf` and `cg`, then `evaln` will first execute `cf` and then `cg` with the output of `cf` as input. Again, by the inductive hypothesis, increasing the fuel limit for each sub-command will not remove any possible output values. Thus, the property holds for the composition command.\n\n* **Precondition:** If `c` has a precondition, then `evaln` will first check if the precondition is met. If it is, it will execute the command. If not, it will not produce any output. Since the fuel limit does not affect whether the precondition is met, increasing it will not remove any possible output values, and the property holds.\n\n* **Find:**  If `c` is a find command, then `evaln` will search for a specific value. The fuel limit restricts how long the search can continue.  However, if a value is found within the fuel limit `k\u2081`, it will also be found within a larger fuel limit `k\u2082`. Therefore, the property holds for the find command.\n\nIn all cases, increasing the fuel limit does not remove any possible output values. Therefore, if `x` is a possible output of `evaln` with fuel limit `k\u2081`, it is also a possible output with fuel limit `k\u2082`. This completes the proof. \n",

The existence of the sum of 'f' over '\u03b2' guarantees the existence of the sum of 'f \u2218 e' over '\u03b3'.\n\nSince we have proven both directions, we have shown that the sum of 'f \u2218 e' over all elements in '\u03b3' exists if and only if the sum of 'f' over all elements in '\u03b2' exists."

We aim to show that the set 's' has a lower bound.\n3. Consider the number 1/U. Since 'U' is greater than or equal to every element in 's\u207b\u00b9', then 1/U will be less than or equal to every element in 's'. Again, this is due to the order-reversing property of reciprocals.\n4. Therefore, 1/U acts as a lower bound for the set 's'.\n\nSince we have proven both directions, we have shown that a set 's' of real numbers has a lower bound if and only if the set of its inverses 's\u207b\u00b9' has an upper bound."

This means that if we take any two elements 'a' and 'b' from set 's' where 'a' comes before 'b', applying 'f \u2218 ofDual' will result in a larger output for 'a' than for 'b'. Since 'ofDual' reverses the order, this implies that 'f(b)' is greater than 'f(a)' in the original order. Therefore, 'f' itself must be strictly increasing on set 's'.\n\n**Direction 2 (Right to Left):**\nNow assume that the function 'f' is strictly increasing on set 's'. This means for any 'a' and 'b' in 's', if 'a' comes before 'b', then 'f(a)' is smaller than 'f(b)'. If we now apply 'ofDual' before 'f', it reverses the order of comparison. So, 'f \u2218 ofDual' would result in a larger output for 'a' than for 'b', making it strictly decreasing.\n\nSince both directions hold, we have proven that the function 'f' is strictly increasing on the set 's' if and only if the composition of 'f' with the 'ofDual' function is strictly decreasing on the set 's'."

In other words, different polynomials will always be mapped to different power series.\n# Explanation: \n1. `MvPolynomial \u03c3 R` represents the set of multivariate polynomials with variables from the set `\u03c3` and coefficients from the ring `R`.\n2. `MvPowerSeries \u03c3 R` represents the set of multivariate power series with variables from the set `\u03c3` and coefficients from the ring `R`.\n3. `Coe.coe : MvPolynomial \u03c3 R \u2192 MvPowerSeries \u03c3 R` is the natural embedding function that treats a polynomial as a power series.\n4. `Function.Injective` asserts that the function is injective, meaning it maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs.\n5. The proof proceeds by assuming two polynomials, `x` and `y`, have the same power series representation (`h`). It then aims to show that `x` and `y` must be the same polynomial.\n6. `ext` invokes the extensionality principle, which states that two functions are equal if they have the same output for every input.\n7. `simp_rw [\u2190 coeff_coe]` simplifies the goal by rewriting it in terms of polynomial coefficients using the fact that the coefficient of a power series at a term is the same as the coefficient of the corresponding term in the polynomial.\n8. `congr` applies congruence, meaning if two expressions are equal, then applying the same function to them preserves the equality.\n# Proof:\n1. Let's assume we have two multivariate polynomials,  `x` and `y`, and their corresponding power series representations are the same.\n2. To prove injectivity, we need to show that if the power series are equal, then the polynomials `x` and `y` must also be equal.\n3. Using the extensionality principle, two functions (or in this case, power series, which can be viewed as functions on monomials) are equal if and only if they have the same output for every input. Therefore, if the power series of `x` and `y` are equal, their coefficients must be the same for all monomials.\n4. Since the coefficients of the power series are determined by the coefficients of the original polynomials, having the same power series coefficients implies that the polynomials `x` and `y` have the same coefficients for all monomials.\n5. Having the same coefficients for all monomials means that the polynomials `x` and `y` are identical.\n6. Therefore, we have shown that if the power series representations of two polynomials are equal, then the polynomials themselves must be equal. This proves that the embedding of multivariate polynomials into power series is injective. \n",

Let's say s = a*v, where 'a' is a scalar from the field K.\n* Now, we consider two possibilities for the scalar 'a':\n    * **Case 1: 'a' is zero.** In this case, 's' would be the zero vector (0*v = 0). But this contradicts our assumption that 's' is a non-zero vector. Hence, 'a' cannot be zero.\n    * **Case 2: 'a' is not zero.**  Since T is a subspace, and 's' belongs to T, any scalar multiple of 's' must also belong to T. This means a\u207b\u00b9*s should belong to T (where a\u207b\u00b9 is the multiplicative inverse of 'a' in the field K). But a\u207b\u00b9*s is equal to 'v'. This implies that 'v' belongs to T. If 'v' belongs to T, then the entire span{v} must be a subset of T (because any subspace containing 'v' must contain its entire span). This contradicts our initial assumption that T is a proper subset of span{v}.\n\n* Since both possibilities for 'a' lead to contradictions, our initial assumption that a non-zero proper subspace T of span{v} exists must be false.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that span{v} is a non-zero subspace and any non-zero subspace contained in it must be equal to span{v}.

Since 'a' is invertible, it cannot be zero (otherwise, it wouldn't have an inverse).\n3. We know that multiplying a nonzero element by its inverse gives the multiplicative identity.\n4. Because 'a' has an inverse, we can multiply both sides of the equation 'a * a\u207b\u00b9 = 1' by \u215f a.\n5. This gives us: \u215f a * (a * a\u207b\u00b9) = \u215f a * 1.\n6. Using the associative property of multiplication, we can rewrite this as: (\u215f a * a) * a\u207b\u00b9 = \u215f a.\n7. Since \u215f a is the multiplicative inverse of 'a', their product (\u215f a * a) equals 1.\n8. This simplifies the equation to: 1 * a\u207b\u00b9 = \u215f a.\n9. As multiplying by the multiplicative identity (1) doesn't change the value, we get: a\u207b\u00b9 = \u215f a.\n\nTherefore, we've proven that the multiplicative inverse of 'a' (\u215f a) is indeed equal to its right inverse (a\u207b\u00b9)."

The proof uses induction on the variable k.\n1. `obtain \u27e8n\u2080, hn\u27e9 := h`: This assumes the existence of n\u2080 and a property hn related to it, likely from a previous theorem or definition of the sequence.\n2. `use n\u2080`: This proposes n\u2080 as the candidate for the existence claim.\n3. `intro k`: This introduces an arbitrary natural number k for the induction.\n4. `induction' k with _ ih`: This starts the induction on k. \n    - The base case (`simp`) likely involves simplifying the expression for k = 0.\n    - The inductive step (`rw [...]`) assumes the statement holds for some k and aims to prove it for (k+1), using rewriting rules based on lemmas about addition, powers, and the property hn.\n5. `omega`: This tactic likely solves the remaining goals automatically based on the previous steps and arithmetic properties.\n\n# Proof:  We want to demonstrate that within the sequence F.N, there's a point (n\u2080) from where any element further down the sequence can be expressed as the element at n\u2080 multiplied by some constant I raised to a power equal to the distance from n\u2080. \n1.

Now, we use induction to prove our claim for any distance k from n\u2080.\n4. For the base case (k=0), the statement likely simplifies to something trivially true (handled by the `simp` tactic).\n5.

Injective functions have the property that different inputs always lead to different outputs.\n3. `cast_inj.1` likely refers to a previously proven lemma or theorem that directly establishes the injectivity of `Int.cast` under the given conditions.",
        "nl_proof": "1. We are given that our number system behaves well with respect to addition and has a zero that acts like zero should.\n2. We need to show that the conversion from integers to this system doesn't accidentally map different integers to the same representation.\n3. The proof relies on a previous result (`cast_inj.1`) which likely demonstrates that this kind of conversion is always injective when dealing with a system where zero behaves normally.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that if two integers are different, their counterparts in the other system will also be different."
