This function acts like a piecewise definition, selecting the appropriate function (`A`, `B` adjusted by a constant) based on the conditions on the real and imaginary parts.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** By constructing the argument function in this way and proving the measurability of each piece and the conditions used for the case distinctions, we establish that the argument function itself is measurable.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the argument function, which determines the angle of a complex number in the complex plane, is a measurable function. This property is essential in various areas of mathematics, particularly in complex analysis and measure theory."

The function `p.toOuterMeasure` calculates the outer measure of a set `s` according to a specific rule defined by `p`. \n2. **Indicator Function:** This function, `s.indicator p x`, acts like a switch: it's 1 if the point `x` is inside the set `s` and 0 otherwise.  \n3. **Summation (\u2211'):**  We're adding things up. The symbol `\u2211'` means we're considering a potentially infinite sum over all possible points 'x'.\n4. **`tsum_congr` and `smul_dirac_apply`:** These are Lean's way of handling technicalities related to infinite sums and the special properties of multiplying by the indicator function.",

This means the value of `p` at `x` directly contributes to the sum.\n2. **If 'x' is outside the set 's':** \n    - The indicator function `s.indicator p x` is 0. \n    -  The term being added is `p(x) * 0`, which is 0.

It sums up the weights of all elements in \\(s\\).\n\n2. **`support`**: This represents the set of elements where the weight function \\(p\\) assigns a strictly positive value.\n\n3. **Proof Strategy**: The proof uses a two-sided implication (if and only if) and leverages proof by contradiction for one direction.\n\n    * **Direction 1 (\u2192)**: If the outer measure of \\(s\\) is 1, it aims to show that every element with a non-zero weight (i.e., in the support of \\(p\\)) must belong to \\(s\\).

This means there exists an element, let's call it 'a', which belongs to the support of \\(p\\) but not to \\(s\\).\n\n3. **Element 'a' and its weight**: Since 'a' is in the support of \\(p\\), its weight, \\(p(a)\\), is strictly greater than 0.\n\n4. **Impact on outer measure**: Because 'a' is not in \\(s\\) but has a positive weight, the outer measure of \\(s\\) would be strictly less than 1 (as we're not including the weight of 'a' in the sum).\n\n5. **Contradiction**: This contradicts our initial assumption that the outer measure of \\(s\\) is 1. Therefore, our assumption that the support of \\(p\\) is not a subset of \\(s\\) must be false.\n\n**Direction 2 (\u2190): If the support of \\(p\\) is contained within \\(s\\), then the outer measure of \\(s\\) is 1.**\n\n1. **Assumption**: Let's assume the support of \\(p\\) is a subset of \\(s\\). \n\n2. **Total Weight**: This means all elements with non-zero weight under \\(p\\) are within \\(s\\).

Therefore, the (i, j)-th entry of the characteristic matrix can be determined as follows:\n    - If i = j (diagonal entry): It is equal to X - C * (the (i, j)-th entry of M).\n    - If i \u2260 j (off-diagonal entry): It is equal to 0 - C * (the (i, j)-th entry of M).\n3. Notice that the diagonal matrix (Matrix.diagonal fun _ : n => X) has X in the (i, j)-th position when i = j and 0 when i \u2260 j.\n4. So, the (i, j)-th entry of the characteristic matrix can be generally expressed as the (i, j)-th entry of the diagonal matrix minus C times the (i, j)-th entry of M.\n5. This is exactly what the theorem states, and since it follows directly from the definition of the characteristic matrix, the proof is complete by reflexivity."

Let's assume we have two linear maps, `f` and `g`, both of which are linear maps from module `M` to module `N`.\n2. Suppose that `(\u2191) f = (\u2191) g`.

We can define a specific function `h` from `\u03b9` to `M` such that `h(i) = m` for all `i` in `\u03b9`.\n5. Using this specific `h`, we know `f(h) = g(h)` from our assumption.\n6.

Therefore, the conjugate of the derivative is equivalent to the gradient in this case.\n\n**Case 2: g is not differentiable at u**\n\nIf g is not differentiable at u, both its gradient and derivative at u are defined as zero.

Here's a breakdown:\n1. `HasGradientAt f f' x`: This signifies that the function \\(f\\) has a gradient of \\(f'\\) at the point \\(x\\).  Intuitively, this means that the function can be well-approximated by a linear function (represented by the gradient) near the point \\(x\\).\n2. `(fun h => f (x + h) - f x - \u27eaf', h\u27eb) =o[\ud835\udcdd 0] fun h => h`: This part expresses the \"very small\" condition formally. \n   - `fun h => f (x + h) - f x` represents the difference between the function's value at a point \\(x + h\\) near \\(x\\) and its value at \\(x\\).\n   - `\u27eaf', h\u27eb` is the dot product of the gradient \\(f'\\) and the displacement \\(h\\). This represents the linear approximation of the function's change near \\(x\\).\n   - `=o[\ud835\udcdd 0]` means that the expression on the left becomes \"negligible\" compared to `h` as `h` approaches zero.

Now, consider taking smaller and smaller nonzero scalars approaching \\(0\\). As we do this, the scaling operation shrinks the set \\(t\\) towards the origin. Since \\(s\\) absorbed the original \\(t\\), it will also contain these scaled-down versions of \\(t\\) as the scaling factor gets arbitrarily small.

This means there's a small punctured neighborhood around \\(0\\) where any nonzero \\(c\\) from this neighborhood, when used to scale \\(t\\), will keep the result within \\(s\\). Now, if we take the reciprocals of these small \\(c\\) values, we get large values. Since the scaled-down versions of \\(t\\) were all inside \\(s\\), scaling \\(t\\) by these large reciprocals means that \\(s\\) can contain versions of \\(t\\) magnified by arbitrarily large factors. This behavior is precisely what absorption describes \u2013 for any element in \\(t\\), we can find a large enough scalar to bring it inside \\(s\\) by scaling.\n\nSince we have proven both directions, we have shown that \\(s\\) absorbs \\(t\\) if and only if for all nonzero \\(c\\) in a sufficiently small neighborhood of \\(0\\), scaling \\(t\\) by \\(c\\) results in a set contained within \\(s\\)."

It constructs functions to prove both directions of the \"if and only if\" statement.\n3. **`fun h \u21a6 neg_neg s \u25b8 h.neg`:** This part proves that if \\(-s\\) is balanced, then \\(s\\) is balanced.

It assumes that \\(s\\) is balanced (represented by `h`) and directly infers that \\(-s\\) must also be balanced by applying the property of being balanced to the negated elements.\n# Proof: \nWe need to prove both directions:\n\n**Direction 1: If \\(-s\\) is balanced, then \\(s\\) is balanced.**\n\n1.

Let's take any element \\(x\\) from the set \\(s\\).  The element \\(-x\\) will be in the set \\(-s\\).\n3. Since \\(-s\\) is balanced, for any scalar \\(a\\) in \\(\ud835\udd5c\\) with \\(|a| \u2264 1\\), the element \\(a \\cdot (-x)\\) must also be in \\(-s\\).\n4. We can rewrite  \\(a \\cdot (-x)\\) as \\((-a) \\cdot x\\).\n5. Since \\((-a) \\cdot x\\) is in \\(-s\\), this means that \\(a \\cdot x\\) is in \\(s\\).\n6.

Now, consider any element \\(y\\) in \\(-s\\). This means there exists an element \\(x\\) in \\(s\\) such that \\(y = -x\\).\n3. For any scalar \\(a\\) in \\(\ud835\udd5c\\) with \\(|a| \u2264 1\\), we know that \\(a \\cdot x\\) is in \\(s\\) (because \\(s\\) is balanced).\n4.

This proves that the set of functions and the specific \"product set\" construction are essentially two different ways of representing the same mathematical object."

        "nl_proof": "1. We need to show that the entire space (the set of all points in the vector space `E`) is convex.\n2. By definition, a set is convex if, for any two points within the set, the line segment connecting them is also entirely contained within the set.\n3. Since we are considering the entire space, any two points we choose will always be within the set.\n4. Furthermore, because we are dealing with the entire space, the line segment connecting any two points will also be entirely contained within the space.\n5. We can leverage the fact that the universal set is star-convex. This means there exists a point in the space such that a line segment connecting it to any other point is entirely within the space. Since any point can serve as this \"center\" point for the entire space, it follows that any line segment between any two points is within the space.\n6. Therefore, the entire space satisfies the definition of a convex set."

Now, let's take an arbitrary element `x` that belongs to the union of all faces in K.\n2. This means `x` must belong to at least one face of K, let's call this face `s`.\n3. Since a simplicial complex is downward closed, and `s` is a face containing `x`, the singleton set containing only `x` is also a face.\n4. A singleton face represents a single vertex.\n5. Therefore, `x` must be a vertex in K.\n\nSince we have proven both directions, we can conclude that the set of vertices of a simplicial complex K is indeed equal to the union of all its faces."

Therefore, for any weighted average of -x and -y (with weights 'a' and 'b' where a + b = 1 and 0 < a, b < 1), the value of the logarithm at that weighted average is strictly greater than the weighted average of the logarithms at -x and -y.\n4. **Transforming Back to Negative Numbers:** Using the property that log(-z) = log(z) for any number z, we can rewrite the inequality obtained in step 3 in terms of x and y. This transformed inequality demonstrates that the strict concavity condition holds for the logarithm function on the negative numbers x and y as well.\n5. **Generalization:** Since x and y were arbitrary negative numbers, this proof holds for any pair of distinct negative numbers. Therefore, the logarithm function is strictly concave on the entire set of negative real numbers."

The initial interval below 'a' (Iic a) consists of all elements less than or equal to 'a'.\n4. Since 's' is a lower set, and 'a' belongs to 's', any element less than or equal to 'a' must also belong to 's'.\n5.

Since 'y' is less than or equal to 'x', it belongs to the initial interval below 'x' (Iic x).\n4. By our assumption, the initial interval below 'x' (Iic x) is a subset of 's'.\n5. Therefore, 'y', being an element of Iic x, must also belong to 's'.\n6. This demonstrates that if an element 'x' is in 's', any element less than or equal to 'x' is also in 's', satisfying the definition of a lower set.\n\nSince we have proven both directions, we have shown that a set 's' is a lower set if and only if, for every element 'a' in 's', the initial interval below 'a' is a subset of 's'."

In this case, `toDual \u2218 f` means applying the function 'f' first, and then applying the function 'toDual' to the result.\n3. `StrictAntiOn`: A function is strictly antitone on a set if for any two distinct elements in the set, when the elements are in a specific order, their images under the function have the opposite order.\n4. `StrictMonoOn`: A function is strictly monotone on a set if it preserves the order of elements. This means for any two distinct elements in the set, if the elements are in a specific order, their images under the function are in the same order.\n5. `Iff.rfl`: This tactic in Lean indicates that the statement being proven is reflexively true, meaning both sides of the \"if and only if\" are essentially saying the same thing in a slightly different way.",

Let's break down why this is inherently true:\n\n1. **'f' being strictly monotone** means that it preserves the order of elements.  So if we have two elements, 'a' and 'b', in our set 's', where 'a' comes before 'b', then 'f(a)' will come before 'f(b)'.\n\n2. Now, if we apply `toDual` to the results of 'f', it reverses the order. This means `toDual(f(b))` will come before `toDual(f(a))`.\n\n3. This reversal of order after applying `toDual` is precisely what defines a function as being **strictly antitone**.\n\nTherefore, the statement is reflexively true because the very definition of `toDual` ensures that if 'f' preserves order, then 'toDual \u2218 f' reverses order, and vice-versa. The proof is immediate from the definitions involved."

The dual of a set reverses the order of its elements.\n2. `toDual` and `ofDual` are functions that convert elements between a set and its dual.\n3. `\u2218` represents function composition.

We need to show that the dual of `f`, which is `toDual \u2218 f \u2218 ofDual`, is also strictly antitone. In other words, if we take two elements in the dual of `s`, say the dual of `a` and the dual of `b`, and the dual of `a` is less than the dual of `b`, then the dual of `f(b)` is less than the dual of `f(a)`.\n\nSince the dual of a set reverses the order of elements, if `a` is less than `b`, then the dual of `b` is less than the dual of `a`. Because `f` is strictly antitone, this implies that `f(b)` is less than `f(a)`.  And since the dual reverses order, the dual of `f(a)` is less than the dual of `f(b)`. This is precisely the condition for the dual of `f` to be strictly antitone.\n\n**Direction 2: If the dual of `f` is strictly antitone on the dual of `s`, then `f` is strictly antitone on `s`.**\n\nThis direction follows a similar logic as the first, but in reverse. Assume that the dual of `f` is strictly antitone on the dual of `s`. We need to prove that `f` is strictly antitone on `s`.  Since the dual of the dual of a set is the original set, and the dual of the dual of a function is the original function, we can apply the same reasoning as in the first direction, just reversing the roles of the original set/function and their duals.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that a function `f` is strictly antitone on a set `s` if and only if the dual of `f` is strictly antitone on the dual of `s`.\n",

Since `p.op` has the lifting property with respect to `i.op`, we can find a diagonal morphism that makes this reversed square commute.\n5. Reversing the arrows once more provides a diagonal morphism for the original square involving `p` and `i`, proving that `i` has the lifting property with respect to `p`.\n\nSince we have shown both directions, we have proven that `i` has the lifting property with respect to `p` if and only if `p.op` has the lifting property with respect to `i.op`. \n",

A derivation is a function that generalizes the properties of the derivative from calculus.\n- **smul:**  Stands for scalar multiplication, which is how we multiply elements of the ring R with elements of the algebra A.\n\nThe proof uses these properties and lemmas:\n- **mul_one r:**  Multiplying any element 'r' by 1 gives 'r'.\n- **RingHom.map_mul:** The homomorphism preserves multiplication: the map of a product is the product of the maps.\n- **RingHom.map_one:** The homomorphism maps the multiplicative identity to the multiplicative identity.\n- **smul_def:**  Relates scalar multiplication to the algebra's multiplication operation.\n- **map_smul:** The algebra homomorphism is compatible with scalar multiplication.\n- **map_one_eq_zero:** The derivative of a constant is zero.\n- **smul_zero:**  Scalar multiplying by zero results in zero.\n\n# Proof:\n1. We start with the expression 'D (algebraMap R A r)'. This represents the derivative of the algebra homomorphism applied to the constant 'r'.\n2. We know that 'r' is equivalent to 'r * 1' (using `mul_one`).\n3. Applying the algebra homomorphism, we get 'algebraMap R A (r * 1)'.\n4. Since the homomorphism preserves multiplication (`RingHom.map_mul`), this becomes '(algebraMap R A r) * (algebraMap R A 1)'.\n5. The homomorphism also maps the multiplicative identity to itself (`RingHom.map_one`), so we have '(algebraMap R A r) * 1'.\n6. Using the definition of scalar multiplication (`smul_def`), this can be written as 'smul (algebraMap R A r) 1'.\n7.  Applying the derivative, we get 'D (smul (algebraMap R A r) 1)'.\n8.  Because the derivative interacts nicely with scalar multiplication (`map_smul`), this becomes 'smul (D (algebraMap R A r)) 1'.\n9. Now, 'D (algebraMap R A r)' represents the derivative of a constant, which is always zero (`map_one_eq_zero`). \n10. Therefore, we have 'smul 0 1'.\n11.

It preserves the ring structure when mapping elements from R to A.\n- **r:** An element from the ring R.\n- **D:** Represents a derivation on the algebra A. A derivation is a function that generalizes the properties of the derivative from calculus.\n- **smul:**  Stands for scalar multiplication, which is how we multiply elements of the ring R with elements of the algebra A.\n\nThe proof uses these properties and lemmas:\n- **mul_one r:**  Multiplying any element 'r' by 1 gives 'r'.\n- **RingHom.map_mul:** The homomorphism preserves multiplication: the map of a product is the product of the maps.\n- **RingHom.map_one:** The homomorphism maps the multiplicative identity to the multiplicative identity.\n- **smul_def:**  Relates scalar multiplication to the algebra's multiplication operation.\n- **map_smul:** The algebra homomorphism is compatible with scalar multiplication.\n- **map_one_eq_zero:** The derivative of a constant is zero.\n- **smul_zero:**  Scalar multiplying by zero results in zero.",
        "nl_proof": "1. We start with the expression 'D (algebraMap R A r)'. This represents the derivative of the algebra homomorphism applied to the constant 'r'.\n2. We know that 'r' is equivalent to 'r * 1' (using `mul_one`).\n3. Applying the algebra homomorphism, we get 'algebraMap R A (r * 1)'.\n4. Since the homomorphism preserves multiplication (`RingHom.map_mul`), this becomes '(algebraMap R A r) * (algebraMap R A 1)'.\n5. The homomorphism also maps the multiplicative identity to itself (`RingHom.map_one`), so we have '(algebraMap R A r) * 1'.\n6. Using the definition of scalar multiplication (`smul_def`), this can be written as 'smul (algebraMap R A r) 1'.\n7.  Applying the derivative, we get 'D (smul (algebraMap R A r) 1)'.\n8.  Because the derivative interacts nicely with scalar multiplication (`map_smul`), this becomes 'smul (D (algebraMap R A r)) 1'.\n9. Now, 'D (algebraMap R A r)' represents the derivative of a constant, which is always zero (`map_one_eq_zero`). \n10. Therefore, we have 'smul 0 1'.\n11. Finally, multiplying anything by zero results in zero (`smul_zero`), giving us the final result: '0'.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that the derivative of the algebra homomorphism applied to a constant 'r' is always zero."

Therefore, if `toSubsemiring(S1)` and `toSubsemiring(S2)` have the same elements, then the original subrings `S1` and `S2` must also have the same elements.\n4. Since `S1` and `S2` have the same elements, they are equal sets.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if `toSubsemiring(S1)` equals `toSubsemiring(S2)`, then `S1` must equal `S2`.

Let's assume that the submonoid generated by S1 is equal to the submonoid generated by S2.\n3. Since the submonoids are equal, they contain the same elements.\n4. Recall that a submonoid only considers the addition operation and the zero element. Therefore, if the submonoids generated by S1 and S2 are equal, it means that S1 and S2 have the same elements when considering only addition and the zero element.\n5. However, S1 and S2 are subrings, which means they must also be closed under multiplication and contain the multiplicative identity (one element).\n6. Since S1 and S2 have the same elements (due to the equal submonoids) and they are both subrings, they must also have the same elements under multiplication and contain the same multiplicative identity.\n7. Therefore, S1 and S2 have the same elements under both addition and multiplication, and contain both the additive and multiplicative identities. This means S1 and S2 are the same subring.\n8. We have shown that if two subrings produce the same submonoid, then they must be the same subring. This proves that the function which maps a subring to its corresponding submonoid is injective."

Suppose for every non-zero and non-unit element \\(x\\) in \\(R\\), there exists a prime element \\(p\\) that divides \\(x\\). Prove that \\(R\\) is a unique factorization domain.\n\n# Explanation:\nThe proof utilizes the definition of a unique factorization domain, which requires showing that every non-zero, non-unit element can be written as a product of prime elements uniquely (up to reordering and multiplication by units).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the Lean 4 code and the proof strategy:\n\n1. **`hR`**: This represents the assumption that for every non-zero, non-unit element in \\(R\\), there exists a prime divisor.\n\n2. **`Classical.choose hR` and `Classical.choose_spec hR`**: These represent choosing a specific prime divisor for each \\(x\\) based on the assumption `hR`.  `p` will denote this chosen prime divisor, and `spec` will encapsulate the properties of this chosen `p`.\n\n3. **`UniqueFactorizationMonoid.of_exists_prime_factors`**: This is a helpful lemma that simplifies the proof. It states that to prove \\(R\\) is a unique factorization domain, it suffices to show that every non-zero, non-unit element in \\(R\\) can be expressed as a product of prime elements. We don't need to prove the uniqueness part directly, as it follows from other properties of integral domains.\n\n4. **`fun x hx => ...`**: We start by taking an arbitrary non-zero, non-unit element `x` in `R` along with the proof of it being non-zero and non-unit (`hx`).\n\n5. **`Multiset.replicate (Classical.choose (spec.2 hx)) p`**:  We construct a multiset containing only the chosen prime `p`, repeated a certain number of times. The exact repetition count is determined by `Classical.choose (spec.2 hx)`, which essentially figures out how many times `p` divides `x`.\n\n6. **`constructor`**: We need to show that this constructed multiset represents a valid prime factorization of `x`. This involves two parts:\n   - Proving that each element in the multiset is indeed a prime element.\n   - Proving that the product of elements in the multiset is equal to `x`.\n\n7. **The rest of the proof** focuses on proving these two parts using the properties of prime elements, divisibility, and the specifics of our chosen prime `p` and its relation to `x`.\n\n# Proof:\n\nLet \\(R\\) be an integral domain where every non-zero, non-unit element has a prime divisor.  Let \\(x\\) be an arbitrary non-zero, non-unit element in \\(R\\). \n\nBy our assumption, there exists a prime element \\(p\\) that divides \\(x\\). We can express \\(x\\) as \\(x = p^m * u\\), where \\(m\\) is a positive integer representing the highest power of \\(p\\) that divides \\(x\\), and \\(u\\) is a unit in \\(R\\) (or possibly 1 if \\(p\\) divides \\(x\\) exactly \\(m\\) times).\n\nNow, consider the multiset containing the element \\(p\\) repeated \\(m\\) times. Each element in this multiset is prime by definition.  The product of the elements in this multiset is \\(p^m\\). Since \\(u\\) is a unit, multiplying \\(p^m\\) by \\(u\\) doesn't change the fact that we have a factorization into primes. Therefore, \\(x\\) can be expressed as a product of prime elements.\n\nSince \\(x\\) was an arbitrary non-zero, non-unit element, we have shown that every such element in \\(R\\) can be expressed as a product of primes.

It states that to prove \\(R\\) is a unique factorization domain, it suffices to show that every non-zero, non-unit element in \\(R\\) can be expressed as a product of prime elements. We don't need to prove the uniqueness part directly, as it follows from other properties of integral domains.\n\n4. **`fun x hx => ...`**: We start by taking an arbitrary non-zero, non-unit element `x` in `R` along with the proof of it being non-zero and non-unit (`hx`).\n\n5. **`Multiset.replicate (Classical.choose (spec.2 hx)) p`**:  We construct a multiset containing only the chosen prime `p`, repeated a certain number of times. The exact repetition count is determined by `Classical.choose (spec.2 hx)`, which essentially figures out how many times `p` divides `x`.\n\n6. **`constructor`**: We need to show that this constructed multiset represents a valid prime factorization of `x`. This involves two parts:\n   - Proving that each element in the multiset is indeed a prime element.\n   - Proving that the product of elements in the multiset is equal to `x`.\n\n7. **The rest of the proof** focuses on proving these two parts using the properties of prime elements, divisibility, and the specifics of our chosen prime `p` and its relation to `x`.",

If (g\u207b\u00b9 x) and (g\u207b\u00b9 y) are in the same cycle of 'f', it means we can move from (g\u207b\u00b9 x) to (g\u207b\u00b9 y) by repeatedly applying the permutation 'f'.\n2. Applying 'g' to both (g\u207b\u00b9 x) and (g\u207b\u00b9 y) gives us 'x' and 'y' respectively.\n3. Since (g\u207b\u00b9 x) and (g\u207b\u00b9 y) are in the same cycle of 'f', applying 'f' multiple times will transform (g\u207b\u00b9 x) into (g\u207b\u00b9 y). \n4. Now, applying 'g' after each application of 'f' and finally applying 'g' again to the result is equivalent to applying (g * f * g\u207b\u00b9) multiple times.\n5. Therefore, 'x' can be transformed into 'y' by repeatedly applying (g * f * g\u207b\u00b9), meaning they are in the same cycle of (g * f * g\u207b\u00b9).\n\nSince we have proven both directions, we have shown that 'x' and 'y' are in the same cycle of the permutation (g * f * g\u207b\u00b9) if and only if (g\u207b\u00b9 x) and (g\u207b\u00b9 y) are in the same cycle of the permutation 'f'."

Here's a breakdown:\n1. **Monoid:** A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element. For example, the set of natural numbers with addition forms a monoid (0 is the identity element).\n2. **Free product of Monoids (M \u2217 N):** The free product of two monoids M and N is a new monoid formed by combining elements of M and N in all possible ways, preserving their individual operations and only requiring them to interact according to the monoid axioms (associativity and identity).\n3. **Submonoid:** A submonoid is a subset of a monoid that is closed under the monoid operation and contains the identity element.\n4. **Submonoid.closure:** This function takes a subset of a monoid and generates the smallest submonoid containing that subset.\n5. **range (inl : M \u2192* M \u2217 N):** This represents the set of all elements in M \u2217 N that originate from M via the inclusion map `inl`, which essentially embeds M into the free product.\n6. **range (inr : N \u2192* M \u2217 N):** Similar to `inl`, this represents the set of all elements in M \u2217 N that come from N via the inclusion map `inr`.\n7. **\u222a:** This denotes the union of two sets.\n8. **\u22a4:** This symbol represents the entire monoid M \u2217 N.\n\nThe theorem essentially claims that forming the smallest submonoid that contains both the images of M and N in the free product M \u2217 N will give you the entire free product itself.\n# Proof: \n1. We want to show that the smallest submonoid containing all elements from M and N in M \u2217 N is actually the whole M \u2217 N. \n2. The smallest submonoid containing a set is the same as generating a submonoid from that set using the closure operation. \n3.

The key observation is that any element in M \u2217 N can be formed by a finite sequence of elements alternately drawn from M and N. This is the fundamental property of the free product.\n6. Since the closure operation allows us to apply the monoid operation (which combines elements from M and N) repeatedly, we can generate any element in M \u2217 N starting from the elements in the ranges of `inl` and `inr`.\n7.

So, updating the element at position 'i + 1' in the original sequence and then removing the first element is the same as first removing the first element and then updating the element at position 'i'.\n\n**Case 2: 'j' is not equal to 'i'.** \nIf 'j' is not equal to 'i', removing the first element won't affect the relative positions of 'j' and 'i + 1'. Therefore, updating the element at 'i + 1' and then removing the first element is equivalent to first removing the first element and then updating the element at position 'i'.\n\nSince we've proven the equivalence for both cases, we can conclude that the theorem holds true for all values of 'j'. Therefore, taking the tail after updating an element at position 'i + 1' is indeed the same as updating the element at position 'i' after taking the tail."

This is a special case in modular arithmetic and is covered by the lemma `Int.cast_id`.\n\n**Inductive Hypothesis:**  Assume that the theorem holds for some natural number *n*. This means that for any element *i* in ZMod *n*, casting *i* to ZMod *n* results in *i*.\n\n**Inductive Step (n + 1):** We need to prove that the theorem also holds for *n* + 1. Let *i* be an arbitrary element in ZMod (n + 1).  We can use the lemma `nat_cast_zmod_val`, which essentially states that casting a natural number to ZMod (n + 1) is consistent with the modulo operation. Since *i* is already in ZMod (n + 1), casting it again doesn't change its value. Therefore, casting *i* to ZMod (n + 1) results in *i*.\n\n**Conclusion:** We have shown that the theorem holds for *n* = 0 (base case) and that if it holds for *n*, it also holds for *n* + 1 (inductive step). By the principle of mathematical induction, the theorem holds for all natural numbers *n*. In other words, casting an element *i* in ZMod *n* to ZMod *n* always results in the same element *i*."

Casting `x` to an integer gives us the remainder when `x` is divided by `n`.  Casting this remainder to a real number gives us the same real number as directly casting `x` to a real number.  This is because the process of casting to a real number doesn't change the value of the number, only its representation.\n\nTherefore, in both cases, casting an integer modulo `n` to an integer and then to a real number is the same as directly casting it to a real number. This completes the proof."

The support of an object is the minimal set of these blocks needed to construct it. \n* **Support Preservation:** A function preserves supports if applying it to an object doesn't introduce any new elements into the object's support \u2013 the output can still be built using the same essential blocks as the input.\n* **Uniform Function:** A uniform function treats all elements outside the support of its input the same way. In other words, the function's behavior is only determined by the elements within the support.\n\nThe proof proceeds by showing both directions of the \"if and only if\" statement:\n\n* **Direction 1 (Support Preservation implies Uniformity):**  We assume `q` preserves supports. To prove `q` is uniform, we need to show it acts the same way on elements outside the support. We leverage the fact that changing elements outside the support doesn't affect the overall support.\n\n* **Direction 2 (Uniformity implies Support Preservation):**  We assume `q` is uniform.  We use this assumption and the definition of support to directly show that `q` preserves supports.\n\nThe Lean proof uses tactics like `constructor`, `intro`, `rw` (rewrite), and `ext` (extensionality) to manage assumptions, manipulate equalities, and reason about function behavior.\n\n# Proof:\n\nWe need to prove both directions of the statement:\n\n**Direction 1: If `q` preserves supports, then `q` is uniform.**\n\n1. Assume `q` preserves supports. This means that applying `q` to an object doesn't change the essential building blocks needed to represent it.\n\n2. Now consider two objects, `a` and `a'`, that only differ outside their supports. This means they share the same essential building blocks.\n\n3. Since `q` preserves supports, applying it to `a` and `a'` will result in outputs that can still be built using the same essential blocks.\n\n4. Because `q` only \"sees\" the essential blocks, and those are the same for `a` and `a'`, it must produce the same output for both. This demonstrates that `q` acts uniformly \u2013 its behavior depends only on the elements within the support.\n\n**Direction 2: If `q` is uniform, then `q` preserves supports.**\n\n1. Assume `q` is uniform. This means it treats elements outside the support of its input the same way.\n\n2. Consider an object `a` and its support. Applying `q` to `a` can potentially change its representation, but because `q` is uniform, these changes can't affect elements outside the support of `a`.\n\n3.

        "nl_explanation": "This theorem connects two properties of a function `q`: support preservation and uniformity.  \n\n* **Support:** Imagine you have a way to represent mathematical objects using a set of basic building blocks. The support of an object is the minimal set of these blocks needed to construct it. \n* **Support Preservation:** A function preserves supports if applying it to an object doesn't introduce any new elements into the object's support \u2013 the output can still be built using the same essential blocks as the input.\n* **Uniform Function:** A uniform function treats all elements outside the support of its input the same way. In other words, the function's behavior is only determined by the elements within the support.\n\nThe proof proceeds by showing both directions of the \"if and only if\" statement:\n\n* **Direction 1 (Support Preservation implies Uniformity):**  We assume `q` preserves supports. To prove `q` is uniform, we need to show it acts the same way on elements outside the support. We leverage the fact that changing elements outside the support doesn't affect the overall support.\n\n* **Direction 2 (Uniformity implies Support Preservation):**  We assume `q` is uniform.  We use this assumption and the definition of support to directly show that `q` preserves supports.\n\nThe Lean proof uses tactics like `constructor`, `intro`, `rw` (rewrite), and `ext` (extensionality) to manage assumptions, manipulate equalities, and reason about function behavior.",
        "nl_proof": "We need to prove both directions of the statement:\n\n**Direction 1: If `q` preserves supports, then `q` is uniform.**\n\n1. Assume `q` preserves supports. This means that applying `q` to an object doesn't change the essential building blocks needed to represent it.\n\n2. Now consider two objects, `a` and `a'`, that only differ outside their supports. This means they share the same essential building blocks.\n\n3. Since `q` preserves supports, applying it to `a` and `a'` will result in outputs that can still be built using the same essential blocks.\n\n4. Because `q` only \"sees\" the essential blocks, and those are the same for `a` and `a'`, it must produce the same output for both. This demonstrates that `q` acts uniformly \u2013 its behavior depends only on the elements within the support.\n\n**Direction 2: If `q` is uniform, then `q` preserves supports.**\n\n1. Assume `q` is uniform. This means it treats elements outside the support of its input the same way.\n\n2. Consider an object `a` and its support. Applying `q` to `a` can potentially change its representation, but because `q` is uniform, these changes can't affect elements outside the support of `a`.\n\n3.

Let's break down the concepts:\n  * **q:**  Think of this as some kind of operation or transformation that can be applied to mathematical objects.\n  * **Support (Supp):** The support of an object is the essential part of it that determines its properties. Imagine highlighting the key parts of a blueprint \u2013 that's like taking the support.\n  * **Preserving Supports (SuppPreservation):** If 'q' preserves supports, it means applying 'q' doesn't change the essential parts of the objects it operates on.\n  * **Predicate (p):** A predicate is a statement that's either true or false for a given object. For example, \"is even\" is a predicate \u2013 it's true for 2, false for 3.\n  * **Lifting (LiftP):**  Lifting lets us apply a predicate to a more complex object by looking at its simpler components. If a predicate is true for all the parts, its lifting is true for the whole thing.\n  * **Preserving Liftings (LiftPPreservation):** If 'q' preserves liftings, applying 'q' doesn't change whether a lifted predicate is true or false.\n\n  The theorem states that for 'q', these two properties are the same:\n    * If 'q' preserves the essential parts of things (supports), it also preserves the truth of predicates applied to those things (liftings).\n    * And vice-versa.\n\n# Proof: \n  We need to prove both directions of the \"if and only if\" statement.\n\n  **Direction 1: If 'q' preserves supports, then it preserves liftings of predicates.**\n    1. Assume 'q' preserves supports. This means that applying 'q' doesn't change the essential parts of objects.\n    2. Now, consider a predicate and its lifting. The lifting is true if the predicate is true for all the parts of an object.\n    3. Since 'q' preserves supports, it doesn't mess up the parts.  Therefore, if the predicate was true for all the parts before applying 'q', it's still true for all the parts afterward.\n    4. This means 'q' preserves the truth of the lifting.\n\n   **Direction 2: If 'q' preserves liftings of predicates, then it preserves supports.**\n    1. Assume 'q' preserves liftings. This means applying 'q' doesn't change whether a lifted predicate is true or false.\n    2. We can use a special kind of predicate that's designed to detect if an element is part of the support of an object.\n    3. If 'q' preserves the lifting of this special predicate, it means 'q' can't change which elements are considered part of the support. \n    4.

Therefore, the theorem holds for an empty list.\n\n**Inductive Step:**  Assume that the theorem is true for a list of size `n`. Now, consider a list `L` of size `n+1`, which can be represented as `h :: t`, where `h` is the head and `t` is the tail of the list.\n\n1. We know that every element in `L` is a unit, including `h`.\n2. From the inductive hypothesis, we know that the product of elements in the tail `t` (which is a list of size `n`) is also a unit.\n3. The product of the entire list `L` is equivalent to multiplying `h` with the product of elements in `t`.\n4. Since both `h` and the product of elements in `t` are units, and the product of two units is also a unit, we can conclude that the product of all elements in `L` is a unit.\n\nTherefore, by induction, the theorem holds for lists of any size."

The theorem uses a proof by equivalence, proving both directions of the \"if and only if\" statement.\n4. `\u27e8...\u27e9` constructs a proof of an equivalence by separately proving both directions.\n   - The first part proves that if `x * y` is squarefree, then x and y are relatively prime and both squarefree.

This means no perfect square greater than 1 divides `x * y`.\n\n* **x and y are relatively prime:** If x and y were not relatively prime, they would share a common prime factor, say 'p'. Then, p\u00b2 would divide `x * y`, contradicting the assumption that `x * y` is squarefree. Therefore, x and y must be relatively prime.\n\n* **x is squarefree:** If x were not squarefree, it would be divisible by some square number greater than 1, say a\u00b2. Since a\u00b2 divides x, it would also divide `x * y`. This contradicts the assumption that `x * y` is squarefree. Therefore, x must be squarefree.\n\n* **y is squarefree:** The same logic applies to y.

This means there exists a prime number 'p' such that p\u00b2 divides `x * y`. \n\nSince p\u00b2 divides `x * y`, this implies that p divides either x or y (or both). Without loss of generality, let's say p divides x. Because p\u00b2 divides `x * y` and p divides x, p must also divide y. This contradicts the assumption that x and y are relatively prime. Therefore, our assumption that `x * y` is not squarefree must be false.\n\n**Conclusion:** We have proven both directions of the \"if and only if\" statement, thus showing that the product of two natural numbers x and y is squarefree if and only if x and y are relatively prime and both x and y are themselves squarefree. \n",

The function `untrop` is defined by this inverse equivalence relation `tropEquiv.symm`.\n7. Therefore, the function `untrop` is an injective function. This means that distinct tropical numbers are mapped to distinct real numbers."

Imagine a vector space (the module) and a plane passing through the origin (the submodule). \n2. **SubMulAction**: This represents the action of scalar multiplication from a ring on a module. Think of it as how we can multiply a vector (element of the module) by a scalar (element of the ring).\n3. **toSubMulAction**: This function takes a submodule and returns the corresponding scalar multiplication action on that submodule. It's like focusing on how scalar multiplication works specifically on the plane within the vector space.\n4. **Monotone**: A function is monotone if it preserves the order of elements. In this context, it means if one submodule is included in another, the corresponding scalar multiplication actions also maintain that inclusion order.\n5. **toSubMulAction_strictMono**: This likely refers to a previously proven theorem stating that `toSubMulAction` is *strictly* monotone.  Strict monotonicity implies monotonicity.\n# Proof:\n1. We know that the function `toSubMulAction` is strictly monotone. This means if we have two submodules, say Submodule A and Submodule B, where Submodule A is included in Submodule B, then the scalar multiplication action on Submodule A, as defined by `toSubMulAction`, will be included within the scalar multiplication action on Submodule B. \n2. Since `toSubMulAction` is strictly monotone, it automatically implies that it is also monotone. This is because strict monotonicity is a stronger condition than monotonicity.  If a function preserves order strictly, it must also preserve order generally.\n3. Therefore, we have proven that the function `toSubMulAction` is monotone. This means that the function preserves the order of inclusion when applied to submodules and their corresponding scalar multiplication actions. \n",

By applying properties of inverses (like the fact that an element multiplied by its inverse gives the identity element) and potentially using the `SemiconjBy.inv_inv_symm` lemma, we can manipulate the equations to arrive at the desired result: a\u207b\u00b9b\u207b\u00b9 = b\u207b\u00b9a\u207b\u00b9.\n5. Therefore, if two elements commute, their inverses also commute."

For example, the set of integers with usual addition and multiplication is a ring.\n\n2. **Ideal:** An ideal is a special subset of a ring that is \"closed\" under addition and \"absorbs\" multiplication from the ring. \n\n3. **Prime Spectrum:** The prime spectrum of a ring is a collection of special ideals called prime ideals.  These prime ideals capture important arithmetic properties of the ring.\n\n4. **Zero Locus:** The zero locus of an ideal is the set of all prime ideals that contain the ideal. It tells us where the elements of the ideal \"vanish\" in the prime spectrum.\n\n5. **Vanishing Ideal:** The vanishing ideal of a subset of the prime spectrum is the ideal consisting of elements that vanish (become zero) at every point in the subset.\n\n6. **Galois Connection:** A Galois connection is a pair of functions between two partially ordered sets (in this case, ideals and subsets of the prime spectrum) that satisfy a specific order-reversing property. This property ensures that the two functions interact in a meaningful way.\n\n7. **`subset_zeroLocus_iff_le_vanishingIdeal`:** This lemma states that an ideal is contained in the vanishing ideal of a subset of the prime spectrum if and only if the subset is contained in the zero locus of the ideal. This is the key property that establishes the Galois connection.",
        "nl_proof": "The theorem asserts the existence of a Galois connection between ideals of a ring and subsets of its prime spectrum. To prove this, we need to show that the two functions, zero locus and vanishing ideal, satisfy the order-reversing property of a Galois connection.\n\nThis order-reversing property is precisely what the lemma `subset_zeroLocus_iff_le_vanishingIdeal` guarantees. It states that an ideal is \"smaller than\" the vanishing ideal of a subset if and only if the subset is \"smaller than\" the zero locus of the ideal. \n\nTherefore, by invoking the lemma `subset_zeroLocus_iff_le_vanishingIdeal`, we establish the existence of the Galois connection between ideals and subsets of the prime spectrum, as claimed by the theorem."

Since we already know they behave identically as multilinear maps, the only way they could differ is in their continuity property.

It likely takes an element from the field 'F' and provides information about its quadratic character (whether it's a residue or non-residue).\n5. **IsQuadratic:**  This is likely a property or a predicate that checks if the input (which is the result of applying `quadraticChar` to 'F' in this case) satisfies the conditions of being either a quadratic residue or a non-residue.\n\nThe proof proceeds by analyzing an arbitrary element 'a' from the field 'F' and uses case analysis based on whether 'a' is equal to zero or not:\n\n* **Case 1: a = 0:** If 'a' is zero, it leverages a specific result likely proven elsewhere, represented by `quadraticChar_zero`. \n* **Case 2: a \u2260 0:** If 'a' is not zero, the proof utilizes a result possibly known as the \"quadratic dichotomy,\" represented by `quadraticChar_dichotomy`. This dichotomy likely states that any non-zero element in the field must either be a quadratic residue or a non-quadratic residue.",
        "nl_proof": "Let's examine an arbitrary element 'a' within the field 'F'. We need to demonstrate that 'a' is either a quadratic residue or a non-quadratic residue. \n\nWe consider two cases:\n\n**Case 1: a is equal to 0**\n\nIf 'a' is 0, we can refer to a previously established result, denoted as 'quadraticChar_zero', which likely demonstrates that 0 possesses the characteristics of either a quadratic residue or a non-residue.\n\n**Case 2: a is not equal to 0**\n\nIf 'a' is not 0, we utilize a principle known as 'quadraticChar_dichotomy'. This principle states that any non-zero element within the field must necessarily be either a quadratic residue or a non-quadratic residue. As 'a' is a non-zero element, it must conform to this dichotomy.\n\nTherefore, we have established that for any element 'a' within the field 'F', 'a' must be either a quadratic residue or a non-quadratic residue. This concludes the proof."
