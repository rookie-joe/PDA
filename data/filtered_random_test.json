This property states that a number \\(n\\) in `ZMod 2` is equal to \\(0\\) if and only if \\(n\\) is divisible by the characteristic of the modulo system, which is \\(2\\) in this case. This is represented in Lean4 as `(CharP.cast_eq_zero_iff (ZMod 2) 2 n)`.\n\n2. **Definition of an Even Number**: An even number is defined as any number that is divisible by \\(2\\). This is a standard definition in mathematics. In Lean4, the equivalence of \\(n\\) being even is represented as `even_iff_two_dvd`, where `dvd` stands for \"divides\".\n\nThe proof connects these two concepts by showing that the condition of \\(n\\) being \\(0\\) in `ZMod 2` (which means \\(n \\mod 2 = 0\\)) is equivalent to \\(n\\) being divisible by \\(2\\) (which means \\(n\\) is an even number). This is achieved through the transformation of the characteristic property into the definition of an even number, facilitated by the `.trans` method in Lean4, which allows for the transformation of one equivalence into another.\n\nIn summary, the proof demonstrates that the property of a number \\(n\\) being \\(0\\) when considered under modulo \\(2\\) arithmetic is fundamentally the same as saying that \\(n\\) is an even number, as both conditions are rooted in the divisibility of \\(n\\) by \\(2\\). This equivalence is established through the logical connection between the characteristic property of `ZMod 2` and the definition of even numbers, thereby proving the theorem.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Given two elements `a` and `b` of type `\u03b1`, and a property `p` that can be applied to elements of `\u03b1`, the theorem states that if `p` holds for both `a` and `b`, then `p` also holds for `a \u2294 b`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof exploits the totality of the ordering on `\u03b1`, which guarantees for any two elements `a` and `b` in `\u03b1`, either `a \u2264 b` or `b \u2264 a`. This total ordering allows us to consider two cases for proving the statement:\n\n1. **Case 1:** `a \u2264 b`. In this case, `a \u2294 b` is equal to `b` because, by the definition of supremum, if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then the supremum of `a` and `b` is just `b`. Since `p(b)` is true (as given), and `a \u2294 b` is equivalent to `b`, it follows that `p(a \u2294 b)` is true.\n\n2. **Case 2:** `b \u2264 a`. Similarly, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `a \u2294 b` is equal to `a` by the definition of supremum. Given that `p(a)` is true, and `a \u2294 b` is equivalent to `a`, it then follows that `p(a \u2294 b)` is also true.\n\nThe proof technique involves a straightforward application of the total ordering property and the definitions related to the supremum operation.

This is a fundamental property of `pure` in the context of filters, where `pure b` essentially creates a filter that focuses on the element `b`.

This theorem describes how the `comap` (preimage filter) of a principal filter through a function `m` is equivalent to the principal filter generated by the preimage of the set under `m`.

The statement to prove is that the distance between any element \\(x\\) in the completed space and itself is equal to zero. In more formal terms, for any element \\(x\\) in the completion of a uniform space \\(\\alpha\\), the distance from \\(x\\) to \\(x\\) is 0.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof employs the method of induction on the element \\(x\\) in the completion of the uniform space, which is a common technique in mathematical proofs that involve showing a property holds for all members of a set by breaking the problem down into more manageable parts.\n\n1. **First Step: Setup for Induction**\n   The proof begins by setting up for induction on \\(x\\), which involves showing that the property we want to prove (in this case, that the distance of \\(x\\) to itself is 0) holds for all elements \\(x\\) in the completion of the space. This setup involves specifying two cases to handle all possible elements \\(x\\).\n\n2. **Second Step: Proving the Base Case**\n   - The base case involves proving that the equation holds under the assumption that \\(x\\) can be approached by a sequence of points in the space \\(\\alpha\\). This is done by showing that the equation for the distance is continuous and equals to a constant function (in this case, zero), by leveraging the fact that the distance function is continuous when both of its arguments are the same (the identity function in this case).\n\n3. **Third Step: Proving for an Arbitrary Element \\(a\\)**\n   - For any specific element \\(a\\) in the original space, the proof shows that the distance from \\(a\\) to itself, when considered within the completion space, is 0. This is demonstrated by referencing the property of the distance function in the original space (before completion), which states that the distance of any point to itself is 0. This step relies on the definition of the distance in the completion space being consistent with the distance in the original space for points that are in the original space.\n\n4. **Conclusion**\n   - The proof concludes by linking back to the general induction principle applied at the start, showing that since the property holds for the base case and for an arbitrary element \\(a\\), it holds for all elements \\(x\\) in the completion of the space.\n\nThe lemma and its proof in Lean4 syntax thus demonstrate a foundational property of metric spaces (and their completions): any point's distance to itself is always zero.

In simpler terms, it claims that the set of integers greater than `a` and less than `b` is the same as the set of integers greater than or equal to `a+1` and less than `b`.\n\n# Proof: \nThe proof of this theorem is carried out by showing that any integer `x` belongs to the interval `Ico a.succ b` if and only if it belongs to the interval `Ioo a b`. This is done through the following steps:\n\n1. **Extensionality principle**: The proof begins by applying the extensionality principle, which in this context means showing that two sets are equal by proving that any element belongs to one set if and only if it belongs to the other set. This is indicated by the `ext x` command, which sets up the goal to prove the equivalence for an arbitrary integer `x`.\n\n2. **Rewriting using definitions**: The next step involves rewriting the membership conditions for `x` in both intervals using their definitions. The `rw` command is used to replace the expressions `mem_Ico` and `mem_Ioo` with their definitions:\n   - `mem_Ico` means `a.succ \u2264 x \u2227 x < b`, which translates to `x` being greater than or equal to `a+1` and less than `b`.\n   - `mem_Ioo` means `a < x \u2227 x < b`, which translates to `x` being greater than `a` and less than `b`.\n\n3. **Applying the `succ_le_iff` lemma**: The `succ_le_iff` lemma states that for any integers `a` and `x`, the statement `a.succ \u2264 x` is equivalent to `a < x`. This is applied to simplify the condition `a.succ \u2264 x` to `a < x`, making the conditions for membership in `Ico a.succ b` and `Ioo a b` identical.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the conditions for an integer `x` to belong to `Ico a.succ b` and `Ioo a b` have been shown to be equivalent, it follows that the two intervals are equal.

Specifically, it is shown that the convex hull of \\(s\\), which contains \\(s\\), is itself a subset of the space of \\(K\\).

The theorem posits that if you start with a matrix where every element is zero (referred to as a zero matrix), and then create a vector composed of the diagonal elements of this matrix, this vector will also contain only zeros.

In simpler terms, taking the product of the values first and then applying the non-negative norm is the same as applying the non-negative norm to each value first and then taking their product.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem utilizes the `map_prod` function combined with the `nnnormHom.toMonoidHom` property. Here's a breakdown of these components:\n- `map_prod` is a function that applies a specific operation to each element in a set and then takes the product of all these operated elements.\n- `nnnormHom.toMonoidHom` refers to a homomorphism (a structure-preserving map) from the given function `f` under multiplication to the non-negative norm (`nnnorm`).

The core of this theorem asserts that `ghostMap` is bijective, which means it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). This bijectivity is established on the premise that there exists an equivalence (denoted by `ghostEquiv`) between Witt vectors over `R` and a certain mathematical structure, and this equivalence is bijective.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof is succinct and relies on the property of the `ghostEquiv` function (or rather, equivalence), which relates Witt vectors over a ring `R` with another structure. This equivalence being bijective implies that for every element in the codomain, there is exactly one corresponding element in the domain, and vice versa. Here are the key steps outlined based on the information provided:\n\n1. **Establishing the Basis**: The theorem starts with the assumption that `ghostEquiv p R` is bijective. This is a critical foundation because the bijectivity of `ghostMap` is directly inferred from the bijectivity of `ghostEquiv`.\n\n2. **Applying the Property**: By stating `(ghostEquiv p R).bijective`, we are asserting that there is a one-to-one correspondence between Witt vectors over `R` and the structure that `ghostEquiv` maps to. This implies that for every Witt vector, there is a unique \"ghost\" representation, and for every \"ghost\" representation, there is a unique Witt vector.\n\n3. **Concluding Bijectivity of `ghostMap`**: Given the bijectivity of `ghostEquiv`, the theorem concludes that `ghostMap` itself is bijective. This is because `ghostMap`'s behavior is inherently tied to the equivalence established by `ghostEquiv`. Therefore, the injective and surjective properties of `ghostEquiv` are transferred to `ghostMap`, ensuring that `ghostMap` maps each Witt vector to a unique function from \u2115 to R and covers every possible such function exactly once.\n\nIn essence, the proof hinges on leveraging the bijective nature of `ghostEquiv` to infer the bijectivity of `ghostMap`.

The theorem is formalized as follows: if `P.b` is not equal to zero, then `P.toPoly` is not equal to zero.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof utilizes a logical structure based on implications and disjunctions (the use of \"or\" in logical statements). Here's a breakdown of the proof in natural language, mirroring the logical steps taken in the original Lean4 syntax:\n\n1. The proof begins with the premise that `P.b` is not equal to zero, denoted as `hb : P.b \u2260 0`.\n2. It then refers to a previous result or axiom, `ne_zero`, which seems to establish conditions under which `P.toPoly` can be considered not equal to zero. This is likely a more general statement about the polynomial `P.toPoly`.\n3. The proof proceeds by applying this general result to the specific case of `P.b` not being zero. This is done through a series of implications (`or_imp.mp`), which can be thought of as logical deductions. Specifically, it takes the second part of the disjunction (`or_imp.mp ne_zero).2`) and then further deduces the first part of this implication (`.1 hb`), effectively stating that if `P.b \u2260 0`, then `P.toPoly \u2260 0`.\n\nIn summary, the proof leverages a general principle (`ne_zero`) about the polynomial `P.toPoly` being nonzero under certain conditions. It then applies this principle specifically to the case where the coefficient `P.b` is nonzero, to conclude that `P.toPoly` itself must also be nonzero. This is achieved through a chain of logical deductions, linking the non-zero condition of `P.b` to the non-zero property of `P.toPoly`.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In simpler terms, this means if you take all parts of a polynomial that are of degree `n`, the resulting polynomial will only consist of terms of degree `n`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof proceeds by contradiction and uses the properties of the homogeneous component of a polynomial.\n\n1. **Begin by assuming the contrary** for the sake of contradiction. That is, suppose there exists a degree `d` such that the statement we want to prove is not true for this `d`. This assumption means we are considering the case where the homogeneous component of `\u03c6` at degree `n` does not behave homogeneously for some degree `d`.\n\n2. **Contraposition**: This step transforms our assumption into a form that's easier to work with. The technique used here, `contrapose!`, is a logical maneuver that flips the hypothesis and the conclusion in a specific way. Essentially, instead of directly proving our statement, we aim to show that if the homogeneous component does not have the property we desire (being homogeneous of degree `n`) for some degree `d`, this leads to a contradiction.\n\n3. **Rewriting the condition**: The proof then uses a rewriting step (`rw`) to simplify the condition under consideration. It refers to the definition of the homogeneous component of a polynomial for a degree `n` (`coeff_homogeneousComponent`), specifically to the case where the degree `d` is not equal to `n` (indicated by `if_neg hd`). This shows that if `d` does not equal `n`, the assumption that our homogeneous component behaves differently (i.e., is not homogeneous of degree `n`) leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nThe essence of this proof lies in demonstrating that under the assumption of contradiction, we are forced into a scenario that cannot hold true according to the definitions and properties at play.

Also, an element is in the set obtained by inserting another element into a set if it is either the inserted element or it was already in the original set.\n\n2. **Assumption**: We start with the assumption that `a` is not a member of `s` (`a \u2209 s`).\n\n3. **Goal**: We aim to show that for any element `x`, `x` is in `s \u2229 (t \u222a {a})` if and only if `x` is in `s \u2229 t`.\n\n4. **Proof Strategy**: The proof is carried out by considering an arbitrary element and using logical equivalences to show that its membership condition in `s \u2229 (t \u222a {a})` is equivalent to its membership condition in `s \u2229 t`.\n\n    a. **Right Implication**: For an element to be in `s \u2229 (t \u222a {a})`, it must be in `s` and either in `t` or be `a`.

Here's a breakdown of the proof in natural language, mirroring the logical structure of the original Lean4 proof:\n\n1. **Rewrite `x - y` as `x + (-y)`:** The first step is to recognize that subtraction can be viewed as the addition of the negation. In mathematical terms, `x - y` is the same as `x + (-y)`. This is a common algebraic manipulation that simplifies the analysis by reducing subtraction to more fundamental operations of addition and negation.\n\n2. **Apply the property `p.add_mem_iff_right hx`:** This property states that for an element `x` in `p`, the statement `x + z \u2208 p` is equivalent to `z \u2208 p`. This is applied under the assumption that `x \u2208 p`, which is given by `hx`. By substituting `z` with `-y`, we get that `x + (-y) \u2208 p` is equivalent to `-y \u2208 p`. This step uses the fact that if `x` is in `p`, then adding something to `x` results in an element that is in `p` if and only if that something is also in `p`.\n\n3. **Use the property `p.neg_mem_iff`:** This property tells us that for any element `z`, `z \u2208 p` is equivalent to `-z \u2208 p`. This is a reflection of the idea that if an element is in `p`, its negation is also in `p`, and vice versa. Applying this to `-y`, we find that `-y \u2208 p` is equivalent to `y \u2208 p`.\n\nCombining these steps, we conclude that `x - y \u2208 p` is equivalent to `y \u2208 p`, given the initial condition that `x \u2208 p`. This proof relies on the algebraic manipulation of subtraction into addition and negation, and the properties of the structure `p` that relate to addition and negation of its elements.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The condition is that `a` and `b` are adjacent in this infimum graph if and only if `a` and `b` are adjacent in every graph in the family and `a` does not equal `b`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof proceeds by simplifying the definition of adjacency in the infimum of a family of simple graphs, as denoted by the `simp [iInf]` command.

In simpler terms, it tells us that if you consider the empty set (a set with no elements) and look for all the elements that could be considered as lower bounds (elements that are less than or equal to every element in the set) to this empty set, you will find that every possible element can serve as a lower bound. This is because there are no elements in the empty set to contradict this claim, making every element in the universe a valid lower bound.\n\n# Proof:\n1. **Introduction of the theorem in Lean4's syntax**: The statement `theorem lowerBounds_empty : lowerBounds (\u2205 : Set \u03b1) = univ` is presented in Lean4, a modern theorem prover. This syntax represents the declaration of a theorem named `lowerBounds_empty`, which asserts that for any type `\u03b1`, the function `lowerBounds` applied to the empty set (denoted by `\u2205 : Set \u03b1`) equals the universal set (`univ`).\n\n2. **Utilization of a dual theorem (`@upperBounds_empty \u03b1\u1d52\u1d48 _`)**: The proof invokes another theorem, `upperBounds_empty`, albeit in a dual context. The notation `\u03b1\u1d52\u1d48` indicates the order dual of `\u03b1`, essentially flipping the concept of upper and lower bounds. In the context of set theory and order theory, the order dual of a partially ordered set (poset) is a construct where the order of every pair of elements is reversed. The statement `@upperBounds_empty \u03b1\u1d52\u1d48 _` applies this theorem to the order dual of `\u03b1`, asserting that the set of all upper bounds of the empty set in this dual order is the universal set.\n\n3. **Logical equivalence due to duality**: The proof exploits the duality principle in order theory, where properties of lower bounds in the original order correspond to properties of upper bounds in the dual order, and vice versa. By showing that every element is an upper bound of the empty set in the dual order, it equivalently demonstrates that every element is a lower bound of the empty set in the original order. This duality ensures that the set of all such lower bounds is indeed the universal set.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Thus, through the application of the order dual concept and leveraging an existing theorem about upper bounds of the empty set, the proof elegantly demonstrates that the set of all lower bounds of the empty set is equal to the universal set, irrespective of the type `\u03b1`. This mirrors the logical structure and content of the Lean4 theorem and proof, maintaining fidelity to the original mathematical reasoning.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The \"size\" in this context refers to the number of bits required to represent \\(n\\) in binary form.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof employs induction and case analysis on the structure of natural numbers as they are represented in binary. Specifically, it uses `Nat.binaryRec'`, a variant of recursion tailored for binary numbers, to consider each natural number either as 0 (the base case) or as a number obtained by appending a bit (0 or 1) to the binary representation of a smaller natural number (the inductive step).\n\n1. **Base Case**: For the base case, the natural number is 0. By definition, the binary representation of 0 is a list containing a single bit (0), and the size is 1. The statement holds trivially in this case because both the length of the bits list and the size are 1.\n\n2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for a natural number \\(n\\) (this is the induction hypothesis). We need to show that it also holds for the next number, which is either \\(2n\\) (if appending a 0) or \\(2n + 1\\) (if appending a 1). The proof proceeds by analyzing the effects of appending a bit to the binary representation of \\(n\\):\n   \n   - **Case 1**: Appending a 0 or 1 to the binary representation of \\(n\\) increases the length of the bits list by 1.\n   \n   - **Case 2**: The `size` of a natural number \\(n\\) when a bit is appended (either 0 or 1) to its binary representation, also increases by 1, as `size_bit` reflects the increase in the number of bits required to represent \\(n\\) after appending a bit.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: By applying the induction hypothesis, it is shown that for any natural number \\(n\\), appending a bit to its binary representation (thereby forming the next number in sequence) correctly increases both the length of the bits list and the size by 1, maintaining the equality. Thus, the lemma is proven.\n\nThis proof utilizes recursion tailored for binary representation, induction on natural numbers, and properties of binary digits and size to demonstrate the relationship between the length of a number's binary representation and its size.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The task is to prove that when we consider `s` as a general set (using the notation `\u2191s` to convert it into a `Set \u03b1`), this set is countable.\n   \n2. **Using a Property of Finite Sets:** The proof immediately invokes a property of `Finset` (which represents finite sets in Lean4), specifically `s.finite_toSet`, to convert our finite set into a form that explicitly acknowledges its finiteness in a broader set context. This step is crucial because it transitions the problem from dealing with a `Finset`, which is finite by definition, to dealing with a `Set`, which requires explicit stating of its properties to argue about countability.\n\n3. **Applying the Countable Property:** After converting our finite set `s` into a set with an explicitly stated finite property (`s.finite_toSet`), the proof then applies a predefined theorem or property that any such finite set (`finite_toSet`) is countable, denoted by `.countable`. This step is based on the mathematical principle that any finite set can be counted, as its elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with a subset of the natural numbers, making the set countable.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The proof concludes that given any finite set `s`, when we consider it as a set in the broader mathematical sense, it retains the property of being countable, as demonstrated by the chain of reasoning applied in the proof.\n\nThis proof is elegant in its simplicity, leveraging the framework and definitions provided within the Lean4 environment to efficiently demonstrate a fundamental property of finite sets when considered within the broader category of all sets.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The theorem asserts that if `f` is a monomorphism (injective on the level of morphisms), then the sequence formed by the zero morphism (a morphism that sends all elements to a zero object, if one exists, in the category) from the zero object `0` to `B`, followed by `f` to `C`, is exact at `B`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is succinctly given in the code snippet through the application of the `\u27e8_, inferInstance\u27e9` construct in Lean4, which leverages type class inference to automatically find a proof that the sequence is exact at `B` given `f` is mono.\n\nTo understand this in natural language:\n- **Exactness** at a point in a sequence, in category theory, refers to the notion that the image of one morphism equals the kernel of the next. Here, being exact at `B` would intuitively mean that the morphism to `B` (in this case, the zero morphism) perfectly maps into the subset of `B` that `f` maps from injectively.\n- The condition that `f` is a monomorphism (`[Mono f]`) is crucial. A monomorphism, or a mono, in category theory, is akin to an injective function in set theory but framed within the context of morphisms between objects. It means that if two morphisms, when composed with `f`, produce the same result, then those two morphisms must be the same. This injective property ensures that the mapping has no \"collisions\" and thus satisfies the exactness condition in a specific sense related to kernels and images.\n- The proof uses Lean4's capability to infer that given `f` is a monomorphism, the sequence starting with the zero morphism to `B` and then `f` from `B` to `C` is exact at `B` without explicitly constructing the argument.

The invocation of `ContravariantClass.elim` indicates that this step likely involves a form of logical argument or mechanism that is specific to the way contravariance behaves in this mathematical framework.\n\nTo translate this into a more intuitive example, consider if `\u03bc` represented a transformation or operation that changes elements in a certain way, and `r` was a relation that, for example, signifies some kind of inequality or order.

Specifically, we consider multiplying by \\(a\\) on the right side of both parts of the inequality. This step is based on the assumption that \\(a\\) is a positive number since the inverse \\(a^{-1}\\) being greater than 1 implicitly suggests \\(a\\) is positive (as the inverse of a negative number or zero would not be defined in the same way).\n\n3. **Apply the property \\(a \\times a^{-1} = 1\\):** This is a fundamental property of the inverse function, which states that a number multiplied by its inverse equals 1.\n\n4. **Simplify the inequality:** After the multiplication, the inequality \\(1 < a^{-1}\\) transforms into \\(a < 1\\) when we multiply both sides by \\(a\\), and apply the inverse multiplication property.

The `not_forall` part translates to moving from a universal statement (something is true for all elements) to an existential statement (there is at least one element for which the statement is not true). Similarly, `not_ne_iff` transforms a statement about inequality (not being the successor of any element) into one about equality (being the successor of some specific element).\n\n3. **Conclusion with `rfl`**: Finally, the proof concludes with `rfl`, which stands for reflexivity.

A walk is considered a trail if it does not repeat any edges, which can be formally stated as each edge appearing at most once in the walk.\n\n1. **Reduction to List Property**: The property of a walk being a trail can be reduced to a property of lists, specifically, that the list of edges in the walk has no duplicates. This is formally captured by the condition that each edge appears in the list at most once, which aligns with the definition of `List.nodup_iff_count_le_one` in Lean4. This means for any edge \\(e\\), the count of \\(e\\) in the list of edges of the walk is less than or equal to one.\n\n2. **Case Analysis on Edge Presence**: To verify this condition for every edge \\(e\\), we perform a case analysis based on whether \\(e\\) is an edge in the walk \\(p\\) or not.\n   \n   - **Case 1 (Edge in Walk)**: If \\(e\\) is an edge in the walk \\(p\\), we use the hypothesis that \\(p\\) is an Eulerian walk.

However, it's important to note that the provided code snippet is quite brief and lacks the context and detail that would typically be found in a full Lean4 proof. Nonetheless, I'll do my best to interpret and translate the given information.\n\n# Statement:\nThe theorem concerns a mathematical structure `M` and a set `s` within `M`. It states that if `s` is a countable set, then the closure of `s` under some language `L` is countably generated (`CG`). In formal terms, `CG` refers to a property where a set can be described or generated by a countably infinite set or a smaller set. The language `L` here refers to a formal language used to describe certain properties or operations within the structure `M`. The `closure` of a set `s` under `L` refers to the smallest closed set that contains `s` and is closed under the operations or relations described by `L`.\n\n# Proof:\n1. **Given**: We start with a set `s` within a mathematical structure `M` and the assumption that `s` is countable (`hs : s.Countable`).\n\n2. **To Prove**: We need to show that the closure of `s` under the language `L` (`closure L s`) is countably generated (`CG`).\n\n3. **Proof Strategy**: The proof leverages a direct construction method, where we use the given set `s` and its properties to directly show the desired property of its closure.\n\n4. **Execution**:\n   - We consider the closure of `s` under `L`, denoted as `closure L s`. By the definition of closure, this is the smallest set containing `s` that is closed under the operations or relations described by `L`.\n   - Since `s` is countable (as given by `hs : s.Countable`), and the closure of `s` under `L` is constructed from `s` by applying the operations or relations of `L`, the resulting set (the closure) does not introduce any new elements outside of what can be generated from `s`. Therefore, the closure is also countably generated.\n   - The proof concludes by constructing a tuple `\u27e8s, hs, rfl\u27e9` to explicitly state that the closure of `s` under `L` (`closure L s`) is countably generated. Here, `rfl` likely stands for reflexivity or a similar principle, indicating that the property of being countably generated directly follows from the properties of `s` and the definition of closure.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given a countable set `s` within a structure `M`, the closure of `s` under a language `L` is countably generated. This is demonstrated by showing that the process of taking the closure under `L` does not introduce any uncountable elements, thus preserving the countable nature of the original set `s`.\n\nThis translation and explanation aim to capture the logical structure and content of the original Lean4 theorem and proof, despite the brevity and abstract nature of the provided code snippet.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The theorem claims that `finSuccEquivLast` applied to `Fin.last n` yields `none`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is executed through a method typical in formal verification tools like Lean4, which involves invoking a simplification tactic `simp` with the function `finSuccEquivLast` as the subject.

In simpler terms, because the only ordinal less than 1 is 0, the supremum of such a set is just the value of the function at 0.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem unfolds in the following logical steps:\n\n1. **Simplification with Equivalence**: The statement starts by simplifying the expression `bsup 1 f` using the equivalence `sup_eq_bsup`, which says that the supremum (`sup`) of a set can be calculated as the bounded supremum (`bsup`) under certain conditions. This step rewrites our goal in terms of `sup`.\n\n2. **Application of Uniqueness**: Next, it applies `sup_unique`, a principle that if a supremum exists for a set, it is unique. This principle helps in narrowing down the search for the supremum to a specific value, provided we can show such a value satisfies the conditions of being a supremum.\n\n3. **Substitution of Definitions**: The proof then substitutes the definitions `familyOfBFamily` and `familyOfBFamily'`, which relate to how the function `f` is applied over the indexed set. These substitutions help in clarifying the structure of the set over which the supremum is being calculated.\n\n4. **Conclusion by Simplification**: Finally, with the substitutions and principles applied, the proof concludes that the supremum of the set defined by `f` over ordinals less than 1 is precisely `f(0)`. This conclusion follows from the fact that under the conditions specified, the only ordinal to consider is 0, and thus, the supremum must be `f(0)`.\n\n5. **Rationale**: The rationale behind the steps involves understanding how supremums are calculated and the uniqueness of such values in the context of ordinals.

Here's a breakdown of the proof in natural language:\n\n1. **Rewrite using whisker left identity**: The proof begins by applying an identity that relates the operation of \"whiskering\" on the left side of a morphism to other known transformations. This step sets up the equality in a form that is easier to manipulate in the subsequent steps.\n\n2. **Cancel epi**: This step involves the cancellation of an epimorphism (a morphism that is right-cancellable) involving the associator \\((\u03b1_ _ _ _).hom\\). The associator is a structure that adjusts the parentheses in the composition of three morphisms. By canceling an epimorphism, we simplify the equation by removing common elements on both sides of the equation, under the assumption that the morphism is an epimorphism.\n\n3. **Cancel mono**: Similar to the previous step, this step involves the cancellation of a monomorphism (a morphism that is left-cancellable) involving the right unitor \\((\u03c1_ _).hom\\). This further simplifies the equation by eliminating common elements, assuming the morphism is a monomorphism.\n\n4. **Use the triangle identity**: The triangle identity is a specific identity in a bicategory that relates the associator and the unitors. Applying this identity allows us to further transform the equation into a more manageable form, aligning the structures on both sides of the equation.\n\n5. **Apply right unitor composition rule**: This step involves rewriting part of the equation using the composition rule for the right unitor, effectively reorganizing the morphisms involved to align with the desired end state of the equation.\n\n6. **Use right unitor naturality**: Finally, the naturality of the right unitor is applied.

Similar to the second case, this utilizes the representation of negative integers in the system.\n\n4. **Case 4**: The case where both components of `a` are negative, i.e., both are of the form `-x - 1` and `-y - 1`, leads to a contradiction with the premise that `a` is non-negative.

This is a formal way of saying that applying the homomorphism `f` to an element produces the same result as using `f` as a function.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is quite straightforward and is done using reflexivity (`rfl` in Lean4 syntax). In Lean4, `rfl` is used to indicate that both sides of the equation are exactly the same by definition. This means that the way `f` is defined as a `MulSemiringActionHom` (multiplicative semiring action homomorphism) inherently makes its application (`\u21d1(f)`) identical to its behavior as a function (`f`).

In this context, it simplifies the expression `invRev (invRev L\u2081)` by expanding the definitions of `invRev` and applying simplification rules for list manipulation, specifically `List.map_reverse` and function composition `(\u00b7 \u2218 \u00b7)`.\n\n2. **Definitions and Rules Used:**\n   - `invRev`: A function that presumably inverts and then reverses a list. The exact nature of \"invert\" is not described, but it could mean inverting the elements of the list if they represent mathematical objects that can be inverted, such as numbers or group elements.\n   - `List.map_reverse`: A simplification rule that likely states mapping a function over a list and then reversing the list is equivalent to reversing the list first and then mapping the function. This is a common optimization technique in functional programming and list manipulation.\n   - `(\u00b7 \u2218 \u00b7)`: Denotes function composition, where one function is applied after another.

This means that for any two pairs where the first is less than or equal to the second (in the context of the ordering of their second elements), the second element of the first pair is less than or equal to the second element of the second pair.\n\n# Proof:\n1. **Define Monotonicity**: First, we clarify what we mean by monotonicity in this context. A function `f` is monotone if, whenever `x \u2264 y`, then `f(x) \u2264 f(y)` for all `x` and `y` within its domain. Here, `\u2264` denotes a generic order relation that applies to the elements of type `\u03b2` in the pairs.\n\n2. **Applying the Definition to `snd`**: In applying this definition to the `snd` function (`@Prod.snd \u03b1 \u03b2`), the `snd` function's input is pairs of type `\u03b1 \u00d7 \u03b2`, and its output is elements of type `\u03b2`.

Through Lean4's logical framework, the \"`fun _ _ \u21a6 And.right`\" effectively captures the essence of extracting the necessary part of the assumption to establish the monotonicity, focusing on the second elements of the pairs. This expression is a functional representation indicating that given any two pairs, their order is deduced by emphasizing the consequence (`And.right`), pointing towards the second elements of the pairs, according to the order relation between them.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Hence, under the assumption of the standard order relation applying to the second elements of the pairs, the `snd` function, by only considering these second elements, inherently respects this order\u2014thus proving it is monotone. Thereby, for any two pairs where the first is less than or equal to the second (when comparing their second elements), the outcome of applying `snd` to these pairs retains this order relation, embodying the monotonicity property.\n\nIn summary, the lemma's translation and its proof hinge on understanding the order relation among pairs based on their second elements and showing that the `snd` function, by its operational definition, respects and preserves this order\u2014therefore, proving its monotonicity within the types `\u03b1` and `\u03b2`.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This approach is common in formal verification and theorem proving, where complex relationships can often be established through the properties of mathematical constructs and mappings between different types or domains.\n\nIn conclusion, the theorem and its proof together formalize the idea that within the framework of coercion from sets to nonempty intervals, the concept of a subset is directly analogous to the concept of being \"less than or equal to\", leveraging the properties of coercion homomorphisms to bridge these concepts.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This step sets up the structure of the neighborhood filter in terms of a basis from which it is generated.\n\n2. **Simplify the comap expressions:** Next, the proof simplifies the expression involving the comap of the infimum (`iInf`) and the comap of the principal filter, using `simp only [comap_iInf, comap_principal]`. This simplification helps in breaking down the problem into more manageable pieces by considering the effects of `comap` on these constructs individually.\n\n3. **Introduce an arbitrary set `s` belonging to the ultrafilter:** The proof then moves to consider an arbitrary set `s` that belongs to the ultrafilter `b`. This is a common technique in proofs involving filters, where showing something holds for all elements of a filter can contribute to proving a broader statement about the filter itself.\n\n4. **Show `s` belongs to the basis of the neighborhood filter:** By rewriting with `[\u2190 le_principal_iff]`, the proof asserts that `s` is among the sets considered in the generation of the neighborhood filter (through `nhds_generateFrom`).

The code snippet appears to be a mix of a theorem statement in Lean4 and some additional Lean4 commands that are not directly part of the theorem's proof. However, I will translate the core idea of the theorem into natural language, based on the given information and typical usage of such constructs in theorem proving with Lean4.\n\n# Statement:\n\nThe theorem, named `aevalTower_C`, concerns the evaluation of a polynomial at a certain point within the context of algebra. Specifically, it deals with the scenario where we have a polynomial whose coefficients come from a ring `R`, and we are evaluating this polynomial at a point `y` in some algebraic structure that `R` maps into via a function `g`. The theorem states that if you take a constant polynomial `C x` (a polynomial that is equal to the constant `x` for some `x` in `R`), and evaluate it under these conditions, the result is simply the image of `x` under the map `g`.\n\n# Proof:\n\n1. **Understanding the Components**:\n   - `aevalTower g y (C x)` refers to the evaluation of the constant polynomial `C x` at the point `y`, where the polynomial is considered within a larger algebraic structure into which the ring `R` maps via `g`.\n   - `g x` is the image of `x` under the map `g`.\n   - The theorem asserts that these two are equal.\n\n2. **Proof Strategy**:\n   The proof relies on understanding the properties of polynomial evaluation and the specific behavior of constant polynomials within this framework. The key steps, although not explicitly detailed in the provided code snippet, typically involve:\n   - Recognizing that the evaluation of a constant polynomial does not depend on the evaluation point `y` but only on the constant value `x` and how it maps via `g`.\n   - Applying the definition of polynomial evaluation, particularly how constant polynomials are treated in this context.\n\n3. **Application of `eval\u2082_C`**:\n   - The proof uses a lemma or a fundamental property, likely named `eval\u2082_C`, which directly addresses how constant polynomials are evaluated under a map like `g`. This property would assert that evaluating a constant polynomial under such a map yields the image of the constant under the map, which in this case is `g x`.\n   - This step is where the logical equivalence between `aevalTower g y (C x)` and `g x` is established, based on the definitions and properties of polynomial evaluation.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - By applying the relevant properties of polynomial evaluation, specifically how constant polynomials are treated, the theorem concludes that evaluating a constant polynomial `C x` in the described manner is equivalent to simply applying the map `g` to the constant `x`. This conclusion is reached through a direct application of the underlying algebraic principles governing polynomial evaluation and the specific behavior of constant polynomials.\n\nIn summary, the theorem `aevalTower_C` in natural language states that the evaluation of a constant polynomial within a certain algebraic framework yields the image of the constant under the mapping function, demonstrating a fundamental property of polynomial evaluation in algebra.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This step leverages the property of norm casting, which is a method of changing the 'view' of a number from one numeric type to another, ensuring that the operation respects the algebraic structure.\n\nAfter establishing this sufficient condition, the proof proceeds to apply this logic to the specific case of p-adic integers (\u2124_[p]). It uses a technique called \"norm casting\" to transition from the domain of p-adic integers to that of rational p-adic numbers and vice versa, thereby proving the initial statement.\n\nThe essence of the proof lies in showing that if you can establish the equality of two numbers when they are viewed in a more 'general' numeric system (in this case, the p-adic rationals), then this equality also holds when these numbers are viewed in a more 'specific' numeric system (the p-adic integers). This logical flow from a broader context (\u211a_[p]) to a more specific one (\u2124_[p]) underpins the proof's structure and concludes with affirming the original theorem about the equality of `z1` and `z2` as p-adic integers.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

It claims that this pair is equal to the identity pair `(1, 1)` if and only if both `x` is equal to the identity in `M` and `y` is equal to the identity in `N`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof utilizes a property of pairs in Lean4, specifically the `mk.inj_iff` property, which stands for \"make injective if and only if\".

The theorem asserts that a number `l` belongs to this interval if and only if `n` is less than or equal to `l` and `l` is less than `m`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof begins by aiming to show that the condition \"`n` is less than or equal to `l` and `l` is less than `n + (m - n)`\" is equivalent to the original condition \"`n` is less than or equal to `l` and `l` is less than `m`\". This equivalence is crucial for the rest of the proof, and the notation `Ico, this` refers to this critical logical step.\n\nNext, the proof considers two cases based on the total order of `n` and `m`:\n\n1. **Case 1 (`n \u2264 m`):** If `n` is less than or equal to `m`, then `n + (m - n)` simplifies to `m` due to the properties of subtraction and addition on the natural numbers. This case directly supports the initial claim by showing the equivalence between the two conditions mentioned above.\n\n2. **Case 2 (`n > m`):** If `n` is greater than `m`, then `m - n` would result in a non-positive number. In Lean4, `tsub_eq_zero_iff_le.mpr` is applied to handle this case, turning `m - n` into `0` if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Therefore, `n + (m - n)` simplifies to `n + 0`, which is just `n`. This case is a bit more nuanced. The proof uses a logical argument that if `l` is greater than `n`, it cannot also be less than `m` when `n` is greater than `m`. Conversely, if `l` is less than `m` and `m` is less than or equal to `n`, it is not possible for `l` to also be greater than `n`.\n\nThe proof concludes by reconciling these two cases with the original statement, showing that for a number `l` to belong in the interval `Ico n m`, it must be that `n` is less than or equal to `l` and `l` is less than `m`.

The statement asserts that the limit superior of `u` under the filter `f` is less than or equal to the supremum (least upper bound) of the values of `u` at all points `n`.\n\n# Proof:\nTo prove this statement, two main steps are followed based on the properties of filters and the definition of limit superior:\n\n1. **Boundedness**: The proof first asserts the boundedness of the sequence (or function) `u` with respect to the filter `f`. This is essential because for the limit superior to exist and for the comparison with the supremum to be meaningful, `u` must be bounded from above within the context of `f`. This is established by invoking a default assumption or property that indicates such boundedness (indicated by `isBoundedDefault`).\n\n2. **Upper Bound Criterion**: The second part of the proof involves showing that for every element `n`, the value `u(n)` is an upper bound for the set of values considered in the limit superior calculation. This is done by demonstrating that for all `n`, `u(n)` is less than or equal to the supremum of `u`. This step is crucial because the supremum, by definition, is the least upper bound, meaning it is greater than or equal to any other upper bound in the set. By establishing that each `u(n)` is an upper bound and that the supremum is the least of such bounds, it logically follows that the limit superior, which is the infimum of these upper bounds, must be less than or equal to the supremum of `u(n)` across all `n`. This is formalized through the `eventually_of_forall` principle, which, in the context of filters, relates to the idea that the condition (in this case, `le_iSup u`, indicating `u(n)` is less than or equal to the supremum of `u`) holds eventually or for all elements in the filter's base set.\n\nHence, by establishing both the boundedness of `u` and that each value `u(n)` satisfies the upper bound condition for the supremum, the proof concludes that the limit superior of `u` with respect to the filter `f` is indeed less than or equal to the supremum of the values of `u`, thereby proving the theorem.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Specifically, it involves the `swap` operation on pairs, which exchanges the positions of the elements in a pair. For example, if you have a pair `(a, b)`, applying `swap` to it would yield `(b, a)`. The theorem states that swapping the elements of two pairs `p` and `q` results in equality (i.e., `swap p = swap q`) if and only if the original pairs `p` and `q` were equal to begin with.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem relies on the injectivity of the `swap` function. A function is said to be injective (or one-to-one) if every element of the function's codomain is mapped from at most one element of its domain. In simpler terms, different inputs into an injective function yield different outputs.\n\nThe `swap_injective.eq_iff` mentioned in the proof is a lemma that applies specifically to injective functions, stating that for an injective function `f`, `f(x) = f(y)` if and only if `x = y`. This is a fundamental property of injective functions and is key to understanding the theorem's proof.\n\nApplying this general principle to the `swap` function on pairs, the proof essentially says that because `swap` is injective, the only way for `swap p` to equal `swap q` is if `p` and `q` themselves are equal. This is because, for any pairs `p` and `q`, the `swap` function will produce unique outputs unless `p` and `q` are the same, to begin with.

The statement claims that this preimage is exactly the set containing only the element `b`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof unfolds in several logical steps, leveraging predefined lemmas and properties in Lean4's mathematical library:\n\n1. **Rewrite Using `preimage_mul_right_one` and `inv_inv`**: The proof begins by applying two key rewriting rules. The first one, `preimage_mul_right_one`, likely establishes a general scenario for the preimage of a set containing 1 under multiplication by some inverse element. The second rewrite rule, `inv_inv`, is a standard algebraic identity stating that the inverse of the inverse of an element is the element itself. These rewrites adjust the theorem into a form that is directly applicable to the situation at hand.\n\n2. **Application of `mul_left_injective`**: The mention of `(mul_left_injective _).injOn _` suggests the use of the injectivity of multiplication from the left by a non-zero element. This property implies that if multiplying an element by a non-zero number yields unique results, then the operation that led to these results can be reversed uniquely. This property is crucial for establishing that the preimage under consideration indeed yields a single-element set containing `b`.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Following the logical flow established by the rewrites and the application of injectivity, the conclusion is drawn that the preimage of the set containing only the number 1 under the function defined by multiplication by `b\u207b\u00b9` (the multiplicative inverse of `b`) is exactly the set containing `b` itself. This elegantly ties back to the theorem's claim, fully supported by the invoked lemmas and algebraic identities.\n\nIn essence, the theorem and its proof articulate a specific case of how functions behave under inversion and multiplication, showcasing a fundamental property of injective functions in the setting of sets and preimages.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This approach is a common technique in formal verification, especially in the context of data structures like lists, trees, or, in this case, finite maps. The proof is outlined as follows:\n\n1. **Base Case:** The theorem begins by applying an induction principle on the finite map `s`. This is typically done by considering the simplest possible finite map and showing that the theorem holds for it. Although the specifics of the base case are not detailed in the provided snippet, it usually involves an empty map or a map with a single key-value pair. For such a simple map, the theorem's claim is trivially true since removing a key that doesn't exist or is distinct from the only key in the map wouldn't affect the outcome of any lookup.\n\n2. **Inductive Step:** The main logic of the proof is encapsulated in the reference to `AList.lookup_erase_ne h`, which is likely a previously proven lemma or function that deals with a simpler or more abstract version of the data structure, possibly an associative list (`AList`). This lemma/function essentially states that for any associative list, if you remove an element `a'` which is not equal to `a`, then looking up `a` remains unaffected. This step relies on the assumption that the property holds for simpler or smaller instances of the problem (such as a list or a map with fewer elements) and extends it to the more complex structure of a finite map.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** By applying the induction principle and leveraging the previously established lemma (`AList.lookup_erase_ne h`), the proof concludes that the lookup operation's result for a key `a` in a finite map `s` is invariant under the removal of a different key `a'`.

If you think of `\u03b1` as a set of elements, `WithTop \u03b1` is like saying, \"Take all the elements of `\u03b1` and then add an extra element that is bigger than everything else.\"\n\n2. **LE.le**: This is the less than or equal to (`\u2264`) relation. So, `LE.le a b` means `a \u2264 b`.\n\n3. **toDual_le_toDual_iff**: This involves the concept of duality in order relations. For any ordered set, you can consider its dual, where the order of every pair of elements is reversed. The `toDual` function converts an element into its dual order representation, and `toDual_le_toDual_iff` is a statement about the equivalence of the `\u2264` relation in the original order and the dual order. Specifically, it says that `a \u2264 b` in the original order if and only if `toDual a \u2264 toDual b` in the dual order.\n\n4. **WithBot \u03b1\u1d52\u1d48**: This is similar to `WithTop \u03b1` but in the opposite direction. It extends the type `\u03b1` with an element that is considered smaller than all other elements. The `\u1d52\u1d48` indicates that we are considering the dual order of `\u03b1`, so in this dual order, `none` is the smallest element.\n\n5. **@WithBot.none_le \u03b1\u1d52\u1d48 _ _**: This states that in the type `WithBot \u03b1\u1d52\u1d48`, `none` is less than or equal to any element. Since `\u03b1\u1d52\u1d48` is the dual order, this is saying that in the dual order, the element that is smaller than everything else (`none`) is less than or equal to any element.\n\nThe proof proceeds by using the equivalence of the `\u2264` relation in the original and dual orders (`toDual_le_toDual_iff`). It applies this equivalence to the statement that `none` is less than or equal to any element in the dual order (`@WithBot.none_le \u03b1\u1d52\u1d48`). This effectively translates the statement into the original order of `WithTop \u03b1`, concluding that any element `a` in `WithTop \u03b1` is less than or equal to `none`.\n\nIn simpler terms, the proof shows that in the type `WithTop \u03b1`, which includes all elements of `\u03b1` plus an extra \"largest\" element `none`, any element of this type is less than or equal to `none`. This is proven by leveraging the relationship between the orderings in `WithTop \u03b1` and its dual, `WithBot \u03b1\u1d52\u1d48`, and the fact that in the dual ordering, `none` is less than or equal to everything.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In simpler terms, for a matrix with entries of type `\u03b1` in a scenario where the indexing set `n` has the property that all its elements are essentially the same, the matrix must be diagonal. A diagonal matrix is one where all entries off the main diagonal are zero.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof leverages the properties of a subsingleton to demonstrate that `A` is a diagonal matrix. Specifically, it uses the following steps:\n\n1. Given any two indices `i` and `j` of the matrix, the goal is to show that if `i \u2260 j`, then the entry `A[i, j]` must be zero, which is the condition for `A` to be a diagonal matrix.\n2. Since `n` is a subsingleton, by definition, there exists a proof that any two elements of `n`, like our indices `i` and `j`, are actually equal. This is obtained using `Subsingleton.elim i j`, which essentially states that `i` and `j` can be considered identical due to the subsingleton property of `n`.\n3. However, we are considering the case `i \u2260 j`, which contradicts the subsingleton's implication that `i` and `j` are equal. This contradiction is what `(h <| Subsingleton.elim i j).elim` is exploiting. The expression `h <| Subsingleton.elim i j` would attempt to apply the subsingleton elimination to equate `i` and `j`, but since `h` asserts `i \u2260 j`, it leads to a contradiction.\n4. This contradiction allows us to conclude that the only way to satisfy the theorem's conditions without contradiction is if the entries `A[i, j]` for `i \u2260 j` are all zero, because we cannot have `i \u2260 j` in a subsingleton type `n`.\n5. Therefore, by exploiting the unique property of a subsingleton, where all elements are essentially the same, the proof concludes that all off-diagonal entries of `A` must be zero, satisfying the definition of a diagonal matrix.\n\nIn summary, the proof shows that in the context of a matrix indexed by a subsingleton type, the only logical structure that the matrix can have, without contradiction, is that of a diagonal matrix, where all off-diagonal entries are necessarily zero.

This method is based on the concept of filtering elements in a list according to a certain condition and then proving membership of an element in the filtered list implies its membership in the original list before filtering.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We begin with the assumption that `a \u2208 l\u2081 \u2229 l\u2082`. This means that `a` is an element that belongs to both lists `l\u2081` and `l\u2082` simultaneously, by the definition of intersection.\n\n2. **Application of `mem_of_mem_filter`**: The method `mem_of_mem_filter` is applied here. In the context of this proof, think of the intersection operation `\u2229` as a filter applied to `l\u2081` (or `l\u2082`), where only those elements that also belong to the other list are retained. Thus, saying `a \u2208 l\u2081 \u2229 l\u2082` is akin to saying `a` has passed a filter applied to `l\u2081` that checks for membership in `l\u2082`.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: By applying `mem_of_mem_filter`, we deduce that if `a` is a member of this \"filtered\" version of `l\u2081` (i.e., `l\u2081 \u2229 l\u2082`), then it must necessarily be a member of `l\u2081` itself. The filtering process does not add any new elements to `l\u2081`; it only possibly removes elements that are not in `l\u2082`. Therefore, membership in the intersection directly implies membership in `l\u2081`.\n\nIn summary, the lemma is proven by understanding the intersection of two lists as a filtering process on one of the lists, and applying the principle that being a member of a filtered list implies being a member of the original list.

In other words, if you take a set `s` in a field `K`, close it (taking all elements that can be constructed from `s` using field operations), and then map it to another field `L` using `f`, it's the same as first mapping `s` with `f` and then taking the closure in `L`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is structured around demonstrating two things: that `(closure s).map f` is a subset of `closure (f '' s)`, and vice versa, which together imply equality due to the antisymmetry of set inclusion.\n\n1. **First Part ( `(closure s).map f` is a subset of `closure (f '' s)` ):**\n   - This is shown by using the lemma `map_le_iff_le_comap`, which relates the image of a set under `f` to its preimage in a way that's helpful for understanding closures.\n   - It leverages the transitive property of set inclusion (`le_trans`), combined with the fact that the preimage of the image of a set is always at least as large as the original set (`closure_mono <| Set.subset_preimage_image _ _`).

Thus, the logical flow is from the specific condition of the game (no right moves) through a general principle about game valuation (the `zero_le` principle), concluding that the game's value must be 0 or positive. This maintains the fidelity to the original mathematical reasoning by directly linking the absence of right moves to the game valuation relative to 0, using formal tools available within Lean4's mathematical framework.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Here's a step-by-step translation of the proof into natural language:\n\n1. **Simplification using the definition of liminf**: The proof begins by simplifying the expression for liminf using its definition in terms of the supremum (iSup) of infima (iInf) over sets in the filter `f`. This step sets the stage for manipulating the expression to show the desired equality.\n\n2. **Commutativity of supremum**: The next step involves rewriting the supremum of `a` and the liminf of `u` by swapping the order of `a` and the liminf using the commutative property of the supremum (i.e., `a \u2294 b = b \u2294 a`). This is a straightforward application of the property that the order in which you take the supremum of two elements does not affect the result.\n\n3. **Application of a property of supremum over a filter**: The proof then applies a specific property of the supremum over the filter `f`, denoted as `biSup_sup`. This property essentially allows us to distribute the supremum operation over the elements of the filter in a way that aligns with the goal of the theorem. The notation `\u27e8univ, univ_mem\u27e9` signifies that this property applies universally across all sets in the filter `f`.\n\n4. **Simplification involving infimum and supremum**: The proof simplifies the expression further by applying a rule (`iInf\u2082_sup_eq`) that relates the infimum of the supremum of two functions to the supremum of the infimum of those functions. This step is crucial for aligning the left and right sides of the equation in the theorem.\n\n5. **Final commutativity adjustment**: Finally, the proof adjusts the order of `a` and `u(x)` in the supremum operation back to its original form using the commutative property of the supremum. This ensures that the expression on the right side of the equation matches exactly with the theorem's statement.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: By following these steps, the proof demonstrates that the supremum of `a` and the liminf of `u` over a filter `f` is indeed equal to the liminf of the function that maps each `x` to the supremum of `a` and `u(x)`, over the same filter `f`. This concludes the proof of the theorem.\n\nThe proof methodically applies properties of supremum, infimum, and their behavior under filters to establish the desired equality, maintaining fidelity to the original mathematical reasoning in the Lean4 theorem prover syntax.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This completes the proof.\n\nIn essence, the theorem and its proof establish a fundamental property about the operation of adjusting an entity's orientation and then examining its basis representation.

Here are the steps of the proof translated into natural language:\n\n1. **Rewrite the Goal Using a Known Result**: The proof begins by rewriting the goal of showing that `logb b` tends to negative infinity as `x` tends to positive infinity, using a known result about the behavior of functions as they tend to infinity. This is done with the `rw [tendsto_atTop_atBot]` command, which applies a theorem that characterizes this behavior in a general form.\n\n2. **Introduce an Arbitrary Negative Number `e`**: To show that `logb b` tends to negative infinity, we consider any arbitrary negative number `e`. The goal is to show that for any such `e`, there exists a value of `x` beyond which all values of `logb b(x)` are less than `e`. This step is represented by `intro e`.\n\n3. **Specify a Bound for `x`**: The proof specifies a bound for `x` that guarantees `logb b(x)` will be less than `e`. This bound is given by `1 \u2294 b ^ e`, which means the maximum of `1` and `b ^ e`. This is done with the `use 1 \u2294 b ^ e` command, indicating that for all `x` greater than this bound, the desired property holds.\n\n4. **Handle the Case for Any `x` Beyond the Bound**: For any `x` greater than the specified bound, the proof needs to show that `logb b(x)` is indeed less than `e`. This involves several steps:\n   - The assumption that `x` is greater than the bound is introduced with `intro a` and further clarified with `simp only [and_imp, sup_le_iff]`, simplifying the logical structure of the assumption.\n   - The proof then uses the `logb_le_iff_le_rpow_of_base_lt_one` lemma, which relates the logarithm of a number to its power for bases less than one, to establish that `logb b(x) \u2264 e` under the given conditions (`b_pos` and `b_lt_one` indicate that `b` is positive and less than one, respectively).\n   - Finally, the proof concludes this step with `tauto`, which resolves the logical structure of the argument, and `exact lt_of_lt_of_le zero_lt_one ha`, which addresses the ordering of the numbers involved, specifically showing that `0 < 1 \u2264 a`, thereby ensuring that `x` is indeed beyond the specified bound.\n\nIn summary, the proof establishes that for a base `b` less than one, as `x` increases without bound, the logarithm of `x` with base `b` decreases without bound, effectively tending towards negative infinity. This is achieved by demonstrating that for any negative value `e`, there exists a sufficiently large `x` such that `logb b(x)` is less than `e`, thus aligning with the formal definition of the limit of a function as it approaches infinity.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The statement claims that the natural trailing degree of this constant polynomial is `0`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof employs a lemma or a property known as `nonpos_iff_eq_zero`. This property states that for a given mathematical object (in this case, the natural trailing degree of the constant polynomial `C a`), being non-positive is equivalent to being exactly zero.

A monomial is a polynomial with only one term, and the constant polynomial `C a` can be thought of as a monomial where the term is the constant `a`.

In this context, it means showing that `(x : EReal) = \u22a4` implies `x = \u22a4` and vice versa, under the assumption that the coercion is injective.\n\n3. **rfl**: This stands for \"reflexivity,\" a principle in logic and mathematics that states anything is equal to itself. In this proof, it serves as the base or trivial case, ensuring that the equivalence holds by the nature of equality itself, especially in the context of the injective property of the coercion function.\n\nIn natural language, the theorem and its proof collectively assert that for any non-negative extended real number `x`, saying that `x`, when considered as an extended real number, equals positive infinity is exactly the same as saying `x` is positive infinity in its original type. The proof relies on the injectivity of the coercion function, ensuring that equalities hold through the coercion process, and on fundamental logical principles like reflexivity to establish the equivalence.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In mathematical terms, if you have a function that maps any element `a` in a set `A` to its multiples within a certain structure (like a group or ring), the set of all possible outputs (the range) of this function for `a` is exactly the set of all multiples of `a`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is given by `rfl`, which stands for \"reflexivity\" in Lean4. This means that the statement of the theorem is self-evident or directly follows from the definitions of the terms involved without the need for further elaboration. In natural language, this translates to saying that the equality stated in the theorem is true by the very definitions of `zmultiplesHom A a` and `zmultiples a`. \n\nTo understand this better, let's break down the components:\n- `zmultiplesHom A a` refers to a homomorphism (a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures) that takes an element `a` from set `A` and maps it to its multiples in a specific structure (like an additive subgroup).\n- `zmultiples a` denotes the set of all multiples of `a`.\n- The theorem's statement, `(zmultiplesHom A a).range = zmultiples a`, asserts that the set of values obtained by applying the `zmultiplesHom` function to `a` (i.e., the range of `zmultiplesHom A a`) is precisely the set of all multiples of `a`.\n\nThe use of `rfl` in the proof indicates that this equality is a direct consequence of how `zmultiplesHom` and `zmultiples` are defined. Essentially, the definition of `zmultiplesHom` for any element `a` is such that it produces all and only the multiples of `a`, which is exactly what `zmultiples a` represents. Therefore, the theorem confirms that the function `zmultiplesHom` correctly captures the concept of generating multiples of an element within the given structure, and its range for any `a` is the set of multiples of `a`, as expected.\n\nIn summary, the theorem and its proof together affirm that the mathematical construction of `zmultiplesHom` for an element `a` inherently produces the set of all multiples of `a`, and this is evident from the definitions of the involved terms.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In this case, the assertions are `[toSimpleFunc_eq_toFun (0 : Lp.simpleFunc E p \u03bc), Lp.coeFn_zero E 1 \u03bc]`. This step sets up our environment with two pieces of information:\n   - `toSimpleFunc_eq_toFun (0 : Lp.simpleFunc E p \u03bc)`: This states that the operation `toSimpleFunc` applied to the zero function is essentially the same as applying a more basic operation `toFun` to the zero function, within the space of simple functions `Lp.simpleFunc E p \u03bc`.\n   - `Lp.coeFn_zero E 1 \u03bc`: This provides a property of the Lp space, specifically that applying the coercion function (`coeFn`) to zero in the context of `E`, `1` (possibly indicating the Lp space `L^1`), and `\u03bc`, yields zero. It suggests a foundational property about how zero behaves within these function spaces.\n\n2. **Logical Consequence and Rewriting**:\n   The proof then proceeds with the instruction `rwa [h\u2081]`, which is a directive to rewrite the goal using `h\u2081` (the hypothesis from our setup indicating the equivalence of `toSimpleFunc` and `toFun` on the zero function) and then attempt to automatically solve the goal. This is the crux of the proof where it leverages the established equivalence to conclude that `toSimpleFunc` applied to the zero function indeed yields a function that is almost everywhere equal to zero.\n\nIn essence, the proof elegantly demonstrates that under the operations defined in `Lp` spaces and the properties of simple functions within those spaces, applying `toSimpleFunc` to the zero function results in a function that is, almost everywhere, identical to the zero function itself, with respect to the measure `\u03bc`.

A partial order is a binary relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. This context is crucial because it defines the behavior of the \"<\" and \"\u2264\" relations used in our statement.\n\n2. **Classical Decision Procedure**: The proof utilizes a classical decision procedure to handle the logical statements involved. This means we are working within a framework that allows us to assume every statement is either true or false, even if we cannot constructively prove one or the other. This is important for dealing with the negation in \"a \u2260 b\".\n\n3. **Decidable Propositions**: The core of the proof relies on a property of decidable propositions in the context of partial orders. Specifically, it uses the fact that the statement \"a \u2260 b if and only if a < b\" is equivalent to \"a \u2264 b\" under the assumption that we can decide the truth of these statements. This equivalence is not trivial; it encapsulates the nuanced relationship between strict and non-strict inequalities in a partially ordered set.\n\n    - The \"if\" direction (from \"a \u2260 b if and only if a < b\" to \"a \u2264 b\") suggests that if \\(a\\) is not equal to \\(b\\), and this condition is equivalent to \\(a\\) being strictly less than \\(b\\), then it must be the case that \\(a\\) is less than or equal to \\(b\\). This captures the intuition that if \\(a\\) is strictly less than \\(b\\), then certainly \\(a\\) is less than or equal to \\(b\\).\n\n    - The \"only if\" direction (from \"a \u2264 b\" to \"a \u2260 b if and only if a < b\") requires showing that if \\(a\\) is less than or equal to \\(b\\), then the only way \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be unequal is if \\(a\\) is strictly less than \\(b\\). This direction emphasizes the exclusion of the possibility that \\(a\\) could be greater than \\(b\\) under the given conditions.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By leveraging the classical decision procedure and the properties of decidable propositions within a partial order, the proof establishes the equivalence of the two statements: \"a \u2260 b if and only if a < b\" and \"a \u2264 b\". This equivalence is a subtle but powerful insight into the structure of inequalities within partially ordered sets.\n\nIn summary, the proof demonstrates that within the framework of a partially ordered set, the nuanced relationship between not being equal, being strictly less than, and being less than or equal to, can be precisely captured and understood through the equivalence of these two statements.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The `dif_neg hp` part specifies that we are considering the case where `p` is not `0`, which allows us to avoid dealing with the undefined case of the inverse of `0`.\n\n2. **Use the specification of the chosen element**: The next step involves using the `Classical.choose_spec` on the result of `DirectLimit.exists_inv G f hp`.

The theorem states that for any element in the universal set of `\u03b1`, there exists another element in `\u03b1` that is greater than it, signifying that the set is unbounded with respect to the greater-than relation.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem relies on a lemma or a previously proven statement, `unbounded_gt_of_unbounded_ge`, which asserts that if a set is unbounded with respect to the greater-than-or-equal-to relation, then it is also unbounded with respect to the strictly greater-than relation. The universal set of `\u03b1` (`Set.univ \u03b1`) is taken as the context, and it is assumed to be unbounded in the greater-than-or-equal-to sense (denoted by `unbounded_ge_univ`).\n\nHere's how the proof unfolds:\n1. By assuming `\u03b1` is a preorder, we accept that `\u03b1` is equipped with a reflexive and transitive binary relation. This setup allows us to discuss the ordering of elements in `\u03b1`.\n2. The `NoBotOrder` assumption ensures there is no smallest element in `\u03b1`, allowing the concept of unboundedness to make sense in this context.\n3. The core of the proof lies in leveraging `unbounded_gt_of_unbounded_ge`. This lemma states that if no bound exists for elements in `\u03b1` when considering the greater-than-or-equal-to relation, then the same holds for the strictly greater-than relation.\n4. The application of this lemma to `unbounded_ge_univ` (the assumption that the set of all elements of `\u03b1` is unbounded with respect to `\u2265`) directly yields the desired result: the universal set of `\u03b1` is unbounded with respect to the strictly greater-than relation, as stated in the theorem `unbounded_gt_univ`.\n\nIn simpler terms, the theorem and its proof tell us that in a preorder without a lowest element, for every element, you can find another that is strictly greater, indicating the set's unbounded nature in terms of the greater-than relation.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The theorem states that if a set `t` is independent, then the set obtained from the range of `t` is also independent.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof unfolds in several logical steps using the properties and definitions from the domain of complete lattices and the notion of independence within that context:\n\n1. **Translation of Definitions:** The proof begins by referencing the definition of set independence (`setIndependent_iff`). This definition likely encapsulates the idea that for any subset of an independent set, the join (supremum) of that subset is not equal to any element not in the subset, reflecting the independence of elements within the set.\n\n2. **Rewriting with `coe_comp_rangeFactorization`:** The next step involves rewriting the hypothesis `ht` (the assumption that `t` is independent) using `\u2190 coe_comp_rangeFactorization t`.

The phrase `comp'` hints at some form of composition being applied, supported by the surjectivity condition to establish the desired independence of the range set.\n\nIn essence, the theorem verifies that the property of independence for a set `t` ensures that the set defined by the range of `t` retains this independence characteristic.

In particular, it asserts that for any integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, the integer `a` divides `b - c` if and only if `a` divides `c - b`.\n\nIn mathematical terms, using the divisibility notation where `a \u2223 x` denotes \"a divides x\", the theorem can be expressed as:\n\nFor all integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, `a \u2223 (b - c)` if and only if `a \u2223 (c - b)`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem leverages the property that if a number divides another number, it also divides the negation of that number. This is a general property of divisibility.\n\nNow, let's walk through the Lean4 proof:\n\n1. The `rw` command indicates a rewrite step using an existing theorem or lemma. In this case, `dvd_neg` is a lemma that states if `a` divides `b`, then `a` also divides `-b` for any integer `a` and `b`.\n   \n2. The notation `(\u03b1 := \u03b1)` is a way of explicitly specifying the type being considered, which in this context is the type of integers (or a similar structure that supports the concept of divisibility).\n\n3. The `neg_sub` lemma is applied to rewrite `b - c` as `-(c - b)`. This uses the property of negation and subtraction, which is `- (b - c) = (-b) + c = c - b`.\n\nSo in natural language, the theorem's proof is as follows:\n\nTo prove the lemma that `a \u2223 b - c` if and only if `a \u2223 c - b`, we use the fact that a number dividing another number also implies it divides its negative. Since `b - c` is the negation of `c - b` (and vice versa), it follows from the property of negation in divisibility that if `a` divides one of these expressions, it must divide the other.\n\nThus, the statement `a \u2223 b - c` is equivalent to `a \u2223 -(c - b)`, and by the property of divisibility by negatives, it is equivalent to `a \u2223 c - b`. Hence, the theorem is proven.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Mathematically, this can be written as tan(x + n\u03c0) = tan(x), where x is a real number and n is an integer.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem relies on the periodic nature of the tangent function. The tangent function is periodic with a period of \u03c0, meaning that adding any integer multiple of \u03c0 to the input of the tangent function does not change its output.

This is a well-established property of the tangent function.\n\n2. **Application of the Periodicity**: Given the periodicity, for any real number x and any integer n, adding n\u03c0 (where n is an integer) to x results in a point that is an integer number of periods away from x on the tangent function's graph. This means that the tangent function's value at this new point (x + n\u03c0) is the same as at x, due to the periodicity.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, by applying the known periodic property of the tangent function, we conclude that tan(x + n\u03c0) = tan(x) for any real number x and any integer n.

The map function here applies the ring homomorphism f to each coefficient of the polynomial \u03c6, producing a new polynomial in ring S.

This is a foundational concept in the theory of functions and embeddings, particularly in the context of functional programming and formal verification.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem relies on a fundamental property of function-like objects in Lean4, captured by `DFunLike.ext_iff`. The `DFunLike.ext_iff` lemma states that two function-like objects are equivalent if and only if their outputs for any input are identical. Here's how the proof proceeds, broken down into its logical structure:\n\n1. **Invoking Symmetry**: The proof begins by applying the `Iff.symm` function to `DFunLike.ext_iff`. The `Iff.symm` operation takes an if-and-only-if statement (an equivalence) and swaps its sides, proving the reverse direction from what `DFunLike.ext_iff` directly states. Essentially, if `DFunLike.ext_iff` asserts A \u2194 B, `Iff.symm` applied to it would yield B \u2194 A.\n\n2. **Application to Embeddings**: The particular case of `DFunLike.ext_iff` being invoked here pertains to embeddings, which are specific types of function-like objects that preserve structure between domains. By applying `Iff.symm` to `DFunLike.ext_iff`, the proof establishes the desired equivalence for the embedding functions `f` and `g` specifically, stating that `f = g` if and only if for all `x`, `f x = g x`.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The logical flow concludes that the equality of the functions `f` and `g` (in the sense of them being the same embedding from `\u03b1` to `\u03b2`) directly corresponds to these functions producing the same output for any given input. This captures a deep insight about function equality in the realm of formal verification and programming: two functions are the same not merely by having the same definition but by behaving identically across all possible inputs.\n\nThe essence of this proof lies in leveraging the generic property of function-like objects regarding their equivalence criteria and applying it to the specific case of embedding functions, demonstrating a powerful method of proof in the context of formal methods and functional programming.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The theorem asserts that `p.map f` is equal to the zero polynomial if and only if `p` itself is the zero polynomial, given that the function `f` is injective.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem leverages a couple of key concepts: the `mapRingHom` function and the property of injectivity.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: The theorem begins by considering the mapping of a polynomial `p` through a function `f`, denoted as `p.map f`. The goal is to establish a relationship between this mapping resulting in a zero polynomial and the original polynomial `p` being the zero polynomial.\n\n2. **Use of `mapRingHom`**: The `mapRingHom f` is a function that takes a polynomial and applies the function `f` to each of its coefficients, producing a new polynomial. This is a crucial step in the proof because it formalizes the process of mapping a polynomial through a function.\n\n3. **Injectivity and Its Implication**: The condition that `f` is injective (meaning that it maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs) is central to the proof. The injectivity of `f` ensures that the only way for the mapped polynomial `p.map f` to be the zero polynomial is if all coefficients of `p` are mapped to zero, which, under the condition of injectivity, implies that all coefficients of `p` must themselves be zero.\n\n4. **Concluding the Equivalence**: The proof concludes by establishing the equivalence (`\u2194`) between `p.map f = 0` and `p = 0` under the assumption of `f` being injective. This is done through the `map_eq_zero_iff` lemma, which states that for a given ring homomorphism (like `mapRingHom f`), the mapping results in a zero polynomial if and only if the original polynomial is zero, provided that the mapping is injective (ensured by `map_injective f hf`, where `hf` is the hypothesis of `f` being injective).\n\nIn essence, the theorem and its proof articulate a fundamental property about the mapping of polynomials: an injective function preserves the zero polynomial, in the sense that if the mapped polynomial is zero, then the original polynomial must have been zero as well.

The operation \"rotate\" in this context means that each element is moved one position forward in the sequence, and the last element moves to the first position. The statement claims that for any element `i` in a sequence of length `n + 1`, applying the `finRotate` function to `i` is equivalent to incrementing `i` by 1, with a cyclic understanding that after the last position comes the first.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof proceeds by considering the structure of the finite list and the position `i` within it, using Lean4's theorem proving syntax and strategies.\n\n1. **Case Analysis on `n`**: The proof starts by considering the cases of `n`. If `n` is 0, then the sequence has only one element. In this case, rotating doesn't change the sequence because there's only one position. This case is resolved by appealing to the concept of a `Subsingleton`, which is a type with only one element, where any two elements are equal because there's just one. So, rotating a single-element sequence leaves any element unchanged, which trivially satisfies the theorem in this base case.\n\n2. **Dealing with `i` in the Sequence**:\n   - The proof next considers the position `i` within a longer sequence (with more than one element). Two scenarios are possible for `i`: either `i` is the last element of the sequence or it is not.\n   \n   - **If `i` is the Last Element**: If `i` is the last element, then after rotation, it should become the first element. This is handled by referencing a specific behavior `finRotate_last`, which essentially states that the last element moves to the first position upon rotation. This aligns with the theorem's claim when considering the cyclic nature of rotation.\n   \n   - **If `i` is Not the Last Element**: For elements that are not the last, the proof proceeds by induction on `i`. The critical insight is that if `i` is not the last element, then `i + 1` remains within the bounds of the sequence. The argument uses properties of `Fin` (a type representing finite sequences), specifically leveraging the fact that incrementing the index `i` does not exceed the sequence's length and thus can be safely done within this finite context. The proof uses the `Nat.mod_eq_of_lt` property to handle the modulo operation inherent in the cyclic nature of rotation, ensuring that after the last position, indices continue from the start.\n\nIn essence, the proof articulates that for a sequence of length `n + 1`, rotating any element `i` forwards by one position is equivalent to incrementing `i` by 1, considering the sequence's cyclic nature.

Specifically, it asserts that the cardinality of set \u03b2 (the number of elements in \u03b2) is less than or equal to the cardinality of set \u03b1 (the number of elements in \u03b1) if there exists a surjective function f from \u03b1 to \u03b2.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this statement utilizes a fundamental property of functions: a function from set \u03b1 to set \u03b2 is surjective if for every element in \u03b2, there is at least one element in \u03b1 that maps to it under the function f. The proof strategy involves showing that if a surjective function exists, then it is possible to construct an injective (one-to-one) function going in the opposite direction, from \u03b2 back to \u03b1, using the concept of the \"surjective inverse\" (surjInv) of f. \n\nHere are the steps of the proof in more detail:\n1. **Given**: A function f from \u03b1 to \u03b2 that is surjective, as indicated by the hypothesis h.\n2. **To Prove**: The cardinality of \u03b2 is less than or equal to the cardinality of \u03b1.\n3. **Method**: Use the property that the surjective function f has a surjective inverse, which is made injective by the condition of surjectivity of f. This inverse function effectively maps each element of \u03b2 to a unique element of \u03b1 because, by definition, surjectivity of f ensures that every element in \u03b2 is the image of some element in \u03b1 under f. The injectiveness of the surjective inverse guarantees that this mapping does not repeat elements in \u03b1 for different elements in \u03b2.\n4. **Conclusion**: By establishing an injective function from \u03b2 to \u03b1, we can conclude that the cardinality of \u03b2 (the number of distinct outputs) is less than or equal to the cardinality of \u03b1 (the number of distinct inputs). This is a direct application of the principle that an injective function cannot have more outputs than inputs, thus completing the proof.\n\nThis proof leverages the connection between surjectivity and injectivity to relate the sizes of two sets when there is a surjective function connecting them.

In simpler terms, if you multiply two non-infinite hyperreal numbers together and then find the standard part of the result, this will be the same as if you found the standard parts of each number first and then multiplied those standard parts together.\n\n# Proof:\n1.

The proof starts with the associative property of multiplication, which is expressed in Lean4 syntax as \\((mul_assoc _ _ _)\\). This property states that for any three elements \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) in \\(\\alpha\\), the equation \\((x * y) * z = x * (y * z)\\) holds. In our context, it rearranges the left side of our equation to group the operations in a way that facilitates further simplification.\n\n2. The next step involves an inline proof (denoted by `trans <| by rw [Units.inv_mul, mul_one]` in Lean4).

By applying these properties, the proof effectively replaces the division and multiplication by \\(u\\) with operations that simplify to \\(a\\) itself. The division by \\(u\\) is equivalent to multiplying by \\(u^{-1}\\), and when this is followed by multiplying by \\(u\\), it invokes the \\(Units.inv_mul\\) property, simplifying to multiplication by \\(1\\) (\\(a * 1\\)), and finally, by \\(mul_one\\), yielding \\(a\\).\n\nThus, the lemma is proven by demonstrating that dividing an element by a unit and then multiplying by that unit effectively cancels out the division, leaving the original element unchanged, using fundamental properties of multiplication and units in the set \\(\\alpha\\).\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The core assertion is that applying `iterToSum` to `X b` (where `b` is an element of `S\u2081`) results in `X (Sum.inl b)`. This is a way of saying that the operation `iterToSum` transforms `X b` into a form that is still recognizable as an `X` object, but now tagged or marked in a way (`Sum.inl`) that reflects its origin or category as belonging to the first part (`S\u2081`) of a sum type.

This reflexivity stems from the definitions of the mapping of submodules and the linear map's action on submodules.\n\nTo understand the theorem in natural language and the rationale behind using reflexivity for its proof, we should delve into the components involved:\n\n- **Submodule N of R-module M**: This is a subset of M that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication by elements in R, making it a module over R itself.\n- **Linear map f: M \u2192 M'**: A function between two modules (M and M') over the same ring R that respects addition and scalar multiplication.

Specifically, it asserts that dividing the singleton set containing `a` by the singleton set containing `b` results in a singleton set containing the quotient `a / b`.\n\n# Proof:\nTo understand the proof, we need to delve into the assumptions and methodologies typical in theorem provers like Lean4, although it's important to note that the specific proof steps aren't given here. Instead, the reference to `image\u2082_singleton` suggests that the proof leverages an existing theorem or lemma within Lean4's libraries that pertains to the behavior of operations over sets, particularly focusing on the concept of image sets under binary operations.\n\nThe essence of the lemma `singleton_div_singleton` can be understood as follows:\n\n1. **Definition of Division over Sets**: The operation of division over sets, denoted here as `/`, is likely defined in terms of the image of a binary operation. Specifically, for singleton sets, dividing `{a}` by `{b}` involves applying the division operation to every possible pair consisting of one element from each set. Since both are singleton sets, there's only one such pair: `(a, b)`.\n\n2. **Application of the `image\u2082_singleton` Lemma or Theorem**: This step uses a predefined result or method in Lean4, which asserts that when you apply a binary operation (in this case, division) across elements of singleton sets, the result is a singleton set containing the result of the operation applied to the single elements of those sets. Hence, applying division to `a` and `b` yields `{a / b}`.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The proof concludes that for any elements `a` and `b` of type `\u03b1`, where division is defined and makes sense, dividing the singleton set `{a}` by the singleton set `{b}` results in a singleton set containing the quotient `a / b`. This conclusion follows directly from the properties of binary operations over sets as encapsulated in the `image\u2082_singleton` principle.\n\nThis proof, while brief, relies on an understanding of how operations over sets are defined and how these operations relate to the elements within those sets. It demonstrates an elegant property of division over singleton sets, encapsulated in a concise mathematical statement verified using formal methods.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In other words, the set `s` and the set obtained by removing all elements of `s` from `t` have no elements in common.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem relies on a previously established lemma or fact, `sdiff_disjoint.symm`. This refers to the symmetric property of the disjoint relationship between two sets when one is subtracted from the other. Essentially, it says that if you have two sets `s` and `t`, and you subtract `s` from `t`, resulting in `t \\ s`, then `s` and `t \\ s` are disjoint by definition.\n\nThe `.symm` suffix indicates the use of symmetry in the relationship; that is, if `t \\ s` is disjoint from `s` (as `sdiff_disjoint` directly implies), then it must also be true in reverse (by symmetry) that `s` is disjoint from `t \\ s`.\n\nTherefore, the core of the proof lies in recognizing that the property of being disjoint is mutual between the two sets involved when one is the result of subtracting elements of the other.

In a simple graph, where there are no loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices, the only way to have a \"path\" from a vertex back to itself without traversing any edge is to not move at all.\n3. **Conclusion:** Based on the simplifications and the properties of distances in simple graphs, the theorem concludes that the distance from a vertex to itself (\\(dist(G, v, v)\\)) is indeed zero, as there are no edges to be traversed.

There are four cases to consider, corresponding to the ways in which one list can be a permutation of another:\n\n1. **Base Case**: If `l\u2081` and `l\u2082` are both empty, then their powersets are also both empty. This is trivially a permutation of each other. This case is handled by simplification (`simp`), which automatically resolves the case by recognizing that the powersets of two empty lists are indeed permutations of each other.\n\n2. **Step Case (Single Swap)**: If the permutation is obtained by swapping two elements `a` and `b` in a list `l` to get from `l\u2081` to `l\u2082`, we use the induction hypothesis (`IH`) on the smaller list (`l`) to show that the powerset of `l` with `a` added to each element is a permutation of the powerset of `l` with `b` added to each element. This is done by first simplifying the expression for `powersetAux'` when an element is added to the list (`simp only [powersetAux'_cons]`), and then applying the induction hypothesis to show that appending `a` or `b` to each subset of the powerset does not affect the permutation property (`exact IH.append (IH.map _)`).\n\n3. **Step Case (Transposition)**: If the permutation is obtained by transposing elements `a` and `b` in a list, the proof involves showing that appending `a` and then `b` to each subset of the powerset is equivalent to appending `b` and then `a`. This is shown by simplifying the expression for `powersetAux'` when elements are added (`simp only [powersetAux'_cons, map_append, List.map_map, append_assoc]`), and then using a functional extensionality argument to swap `a` and `b` (`funext s; simp [cons_swap]`). This establishes that the two operations are equivalent, and thus the resulting powersets are permutations of each other.\n\n4. **Inductive Step**: If the permutation can be decomposed into two permutations (`l\u2081 ~ l\u2082` and `l\u2082 ~ l\u2083`), then by the induction hypothesis, the powerset of `l\u2081` is a permutation of the powerset of `l\u2082`, and the powerset of `l\u2082` is a permutation of the powerset of `l\u2083`. By transitivity of permutations (`exact IH\u2081.trans IH\u2082`), it follows that the powerset of `l\u2081` is a permutation of the powerset of `l\u2083`.\n\nIn summary, the proof demonstrates that if two lists are permutations of each other, then their powersets, constructed in a specific auxiliary manner, are also permutations of each other.

Based on the given text, I'll attempt to translate and explain the content in natural language.\n\n# Statement:\nThe theorem in question deals with a function that finds the maximum value in a list. Specifically, it states that if the maximum value of a list `l` (where `l` is a list of elements of type `\u03b1`) is `m`, then `m` must be an element of `l`. This theorem operates within the context of Lean4's handling of potentially non-terminating or undefined operations using the `WithTop \u03b1` type, which extends the type `\u03b1` with a top element representing infinity or an undefined maximum.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem relies on a foundational principle or lemma within the Lean4 library, likely `argmax_mem` (as referenced). This principle asserts that for functions (or operations) that determine an `argmax` (i.e., an argument of the maximum), if such a maximum value is identified, then this value must indeed be an element of the original set (or list, in this context) over which the `argmax` operation was performed. \n\nIn natural language, the proof can be explained as follows:\n1. The statement begins by assuming the existence of a maximum value `m` for the list `l`, where this maximum is understood in the context of `WithTop \u03b1` to account for the possibility of `l` being empty or other edge cases.\n2. It then directly applies a known lemma or principle (`argmax_mem`), which states that if a maximum value is determined for a list, that value must originate from the list itself. This principle is crucial because it bridges the abstract definition of `maximum` with the concrete requirement that the maximum value be an actual member of the list.\n3. The use of `argmax_mem` effectively concludes the proof by ensuring that `m`, being the maximum, must be an element of `l`, directly following from the properties and guarantees provided by the `argmax_mem` lemma.\n\nThis explanation abstracts away the specific syntax and constructs of Lean4, aiming to present the logical flow and justification of the theorem and its proof in a manner accessible without deep familiarity with Lean4's specific syntax or semantics.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The `.gc` refers to a general construction that applies to this context, and `u_inf` stands for the universal property of the infimum (here, applied as supremum due to duality).\n\n2. **Logical Structure**: The core logical structure of the proof is based on the principle that the supremum of two filters is obtained by the intersection of their sets. This is because, in the filter context, the supremum (least upper bound) operation essentially identifies the smallest filter that contains all the sets that are in both \\( f \\) and \\( g \\).\n\n3. **Mathematical Reasoning**: The proof implicitly uses the definition of filters (collections of sets that satisfy certain properties like being closed under supersets and finite intersections) and the properties of supremum and infimum in a lattice or partially ordered set.

This known result states that if you have two real numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) where \\(a \\le b\\), and \\(x\\) is a real number greater than or equal to 1, then \\(x^a \\le x^b\\).

This fact is brought in by the use of `(rpow_zero x).symm`, which is essentially asserting that \\(x^0\\) is equal to 1, based on the symmetry of the equation \\(x^0 = 1\\).\n\n3. **Conclusion**: By combining these steps, the proof concludes that \\(x^z \\le 1\\), given the initial conditions that \\(1 \\le x\\) and \\(z \\le 0\\). This conclusion follows from the application of the known result and the basic property of exponents, showing that \\(x^z\\) cannot exceed 1 under these conditions.\n\nThis theorem and its proof demonstrate a fundamental property of real numbers concerning exponentiation, specifically how the sign and magnitude of the exponent affect the value of the exponentiation, especially when dealing with numbers greater than or equal to 1.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The operation in question is `l.getD n d`, which retrieves the n-th element from a list `l`, and if the index `n` is out of bounds (i.e., there is no n-th element), it returns a default value `d`. The theorem asserts that the set obtained by applying this operation to every possible index `n` is equal to the set obtained by inserting the default value `d` into the set of all elements that are in the list `l`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof proceeds in two main steps, leveraging transformations and simplifications provided by the theorem prover's libraries:\n\n1. **Transformation to Option Types**:\n   - Initially, the theorem reinterprets the operation `l.getD n d` in terms of option types. Specifically, it maps every element `n` in the range to `l.getD n d`, which is then re-expressed as applying `fun o : Option \u03b1 => o.getD d` to the range of `l.get?`. The notation `l.get? n` refers to an operation that retrieves the n-th element of the list `l` as an `Option` type, which is `Some(value)` if the element exists and `None` otherwise.\n   - This step is justified by a simplification that combines function composition and the equivalence between `getD` applied directly and `getD` after converting to an option with `get?`. Essentially, it's shown that directly getting a value with a default from the list is the same as first converting the list retrieval into an option and then applying a default.\n\n2. **Simplification to Set Operations**:\n   - The second part of the proof shows that this transformation results in a set that is equivalent to inserting the default value `d` into the set of all elements in the list `l`. This relies on simplifications related to the behavior of option types and set operations.\n   - It uses the properties of `range`, `insert`, and `image` operations on sets and the special behavior of `Option.getD` to demonstrate that the operation on the range effectively simulates inserting the default value into the set of list elements. The argument here is somewhat more intricate, involving the manipulation of sets and option types to show that all elements of the list, along with the default value, are captured in the final set.\n\nIn essence, the theorem and its proof establish that if you try to retrieve every possible element from a list (including indices outside its bounds, for which a default value is returned), and then form a set from these elements, you will end up with a set that contains all the unique elements of the list plus the default value.

        "input": "Statement and proof in natural language:\n# Statement:\nThe statement concerns the field of formal mathematics, specifically within the context of algebraic structures like Rational Functions (`RatFunc`) and Laurent Series over a field `F`. The theorem, named `coe_one`, asserts that when the number 1, considered as a rational function over the field `F`, is converted (coerced) into a Laurent series (also over the field `F`), the result is simply the number 1 (now considered as a Laurent series).\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem utilizes a specific algebraic homomorphism, denoted as `(coeAlgHom F)`, which is responsible for the conversion (coercion) of elements from the domain of rational functions (`RatFunc F`) to the domain of Laurent series (`LaurentSeries F`). The core of the proof lies in demonstrating that this algebraic homomorphism preserves the identity element during the conversion process.\n\n1. **Homomorphism Property**: In algebra, a homomorphism between two algebraic structures is a map that is compatible with the operations of those structures. For instance, if we have an algebraic homomorphism `f` from a structure `A` to another structure `B`, and if `a` and `b` are elements of `A`, then `f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)` and `f(a * b) = f(a) * f(b)`, where `+` and `*` denote the respective operations in `A` and `B`. Importantly, for any identity element `e` in `A`, its image under `f` is the identity element in `B`, i.e., `f(e) = e'`.\n\n2. **Application to the Theorem**: The theorem applies this principle to the specific case of the algebraic homomorphism `(coeAlgHom F)`, which maps rational functions to Laurent series. The identity element in the context of rational functions over `F` is simply the number 1 (considered as a constant rational function). The theorem asserts that applying `(coeAlgHom F)` to this identity element (1 in `RatFunc F`) results in the identity element in the domain of Laurent series (`LaurentSeries F`), which is also represented by the number 1.\n\n3. **Proof via `map_one` Property**: The proof is succinctly encapsulated in the invocation of the `.map_one` property of the algebraic homomorphism `(coeAlgHom F)`. This property directly asserts that the homomorphism maps the identity element of its domain (1 in `RatFunc F`) to the identity element of its codomain (1 in `LaurentSeries F`). Therefore, the statement `((1 : RatFunc F) : LaurentSeries F) = 1` is proven by showing that the coercion of 1 from `RatFunc F` to `LaurentSeries F` via `(coeAlgHom F)` indeed yields 1, maintaining the identity element through the conversion process.\n\nIn summary, the theorem `coe_one` and its proof demonstrate a fundamental property of the algebraic homomorphism `(coeAlgHom F)`, specifically its preservation of the identity element when converting between rational functions and Laurent series over a field `F`. This is a reflection of the broader principle that algebraic homomorphisms preserve structural properties, such as the identity element, across algebraic domains.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The proof begins by asserting that it suffices to show that the numerator of `r` divides the constant term of the polynomial `p` after it has been scaled by the denominator of `r`. This is done using the `suffices` statement, which sets up a sub-goal that, if proven, would imply the theorem.\n\n2. The proof proceeds by simplification (`simp only`) of the expression for the constant coefficient after scaling, using the facts about coefficients of scaled roots and basic arithmetic on polynomial coefficients.\n\n3. A case distinction is made based on whether the numerator of `r` is zero or not. This is handled by the `by_cases` statement.\n\n   - If the numerator of `r` is zero, the proof uses a lemma that states if the numerator is zero, then `r` is a unit (invertible) in the algebraic structure defined by `A`. It then shows that the unit times its inverse divides the constant coefficient of the polynomial, concluding this case with the principle that units divide any element in the ring (`Units.dvd_mul_right.mp`).\n\n   - If the numerator of `r` is not zero, the proof strategy involves showing that no prime factors of the numerator can divide the denominator raised to any power. This is significant because if a prime factor divided both, it would contradict the assumption that `r` is expressed in its simplest form. The proof for this case concludes by asserting that under these conditions, the numerator must divide the constant term of the scaled polynomial.\n\n4. Finally, the proof connects back to the initial statement by converting the specific instance of the problem (divisibility of the constant term after scaling by the denominator) to the general case of divisibility of the constant term. This step uses a general lemma about divisibility when a root causes a polynomial to evaluate to zero, under the condition that the numerator divides all the terms of the polynomial after being scaled.\n\n5.

Each rational number is represented as a fraction, where the numerator and denominator are specified.

The method does this by analyzing the sequence of rational numbers and determining how they approximate \u03c0 from above. The precise algorithm or method it uses for this calculation involves complex mathematical logic specific to the implementation of `pi_upper_bound` in Lean4, which is designed to work with sequences of numbers to approximate values like \u03c0.\n\n4. **Conclusion of the Proof:** By applying the `pi_upper_bound` method to the given sequence of rational numbers, the proof concludes that the value of \u03c0 is indeed less than 3.141593.

Specifically, it states that for any code `c`, natural number `n`, and result `x`, `x` is a result of evaluating `c` with `n` using `eval` if and only if there exists some `k` such that `x` is a result of evaluating `c` with `n` using `evaln` with at least `k` steps. This theorem asserts the completeness of `evaln` in relation to `eval`, meaning that `evaln` can achieve any result that `eval` can, given a sufficient number of steps.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof is structured to show the bidirectional implication required by the theorem. \n\n1. **From `eval` to `evaln`**: It begins by assuming that `x` is a result of `eval`, then proceeds to show that there exists a `k` such that `x` can be obtained by `evaln`. The proof employs an induction on the structure of the code `c`, handling different cases like pairing, composition, primitive recursion, and finding the least number satisfying a certain condition. The inductive cases essentially break down the problem into simpler instances of the same problem, apply the induction hypothesis, and then combine these instances to construct a solution for the original problem. It carefully constructs a `k` for each case that guarantees `x` can be obtained by `evaln` with `k` steps, leveraging properties of `evaln`, such as its boundedness and monotonicity.\n\n2. **From `evaln` to `eval`**: This direction is more straightforward, relying on a previously established soundness result (`evaln_sound`) to assert that if `x` can be obtained from `evaln` with some `k` steps, then `x` can be obtained from `eval` as well.\n\nThroughout, the proof uses various helper lemmas and properties specific to the computational model, such as the ability to bound the necessary steps for `evaln` (`evaln_bound`), and the monotonicity of `evaln` (`evaln_mono`), which ensures that if `x` is obtainable in `k` steps, it is also obtainable in any greater number of steps. Additionally, the proof leverages structural properties of natural numbers and the specific operations of the computational model (like `pair` and `unpair`) to navigate through the recursive structure of codes and their evaluations. \n\nOverall, the proof demonstrates the completeness of `evaln` by methodically building the necessary connections between `eval` and `evaln` across all possible structures of the code, ensuring that for any outcome produced by `eval`, there exists a sufficient number of steps `k` for `evaln` to produce the same outcome.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This property states that the inner product of a scalar-multiplied vector and another vector is equivalent to multiplying the scalar with the inner product of the two vectors. In this case, it simplifies to the inner product involving the zero scalar, which results in the multiplication of zero with the inner product \\(\\langle0, x\\rangle\\).\n\n3. **Use the ring homomorphism property to map zero**: The zero scalar is then processed through a ring homomorphism, which essentially means applying the function that takes a scalar from one ring and maps it to another in a way that preserves ring operations, including the additive identity, which is zero in this case. This ensures that the multiplication involves a zero.\n\n4. **Conclude with zero multiplication**: Finally, the multiplication of zero with any number (or in this case, the result of the inner product, if it were not already simplified to zero) is zero. This step uses the fundamental arithmetic rule that any number multiplied by zero is zero.\n\nTherefore, the proof concludes that the inner product of the zero vector with any vector \\(x\\) in the vector space \\(E\\) is indeed zero, maintaining the fidelity of the original mathematical reasoning provided in Lean4's syntax.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This principle asserts that to prove two functors are equal, it suffices to show they act the same on objects and morphisms of the category. This is a common strategy in category theory proofs, reducing the problem to showing equivalence in action on both objects and morphisms.\n\n2. **Rotation of Goals**: The next step involves rotating the goals using `rotate_left`, a tactic that changes the order of goals to be proved. This is a strategic move to tackle the proof in a more manageable order.\n\n3. **Case on Objects**: The proof then moves to consider the case where we're looking at objects in the category, denoted by `rintro X`. It asserts `rfl`, which means that in this case, the property is reflexively true. This step relies on the nature of how functors act on objects and the specific construction of `lift` to show that, at the level of objects, the composition of `lift r F H` with `functor r` indeed gives back `F`.\n\n4. **Case on Morphisms**: The final step addresses morphisms between objects in the category, denoted by `rintro X Y f`. This step unfolds the definitions of `lift` and `functor` using `dsimp`, simplifying the expressions to work directly with their definitions. Following this, it employs `simp`, a tactic that simplifies the goal using Lean's simplification engine, effectively showing that on morphisms as well, the composition mentioned in the theorem behaves as expected.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: By demonstrating that the composition acts identically to \\(F\\) both on objects and morphisms of the category, the proof concludes that `functor r \u22d9 lift r F H = F`, verifying the theorem's statement.\n\nThis proof is a structured argument that leverages the foundational principles of category theory and the capabilities of Lean4's theorem-proving environment to formalize and verify the equality of functors under specific operations.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The trace of a module can be thought of as a sum of the diagonal elements in a square matrix representation, although in a more abstract sense related to linear algebra and module theory.\n\n# Proof:\n1. **Setting Up an Equivalence:** The proof begins by introducing `e`, which represents an equivalence between the tensor product of the dual module and the original module `M` itself, as formalized by `dualTensorHomEquiv R M M`. This equivalence is a mathematical construction that provides a one-to-one correspondence between elements of the tensor product of the module's dual and the module.\n\n2. **Establishing Surjectivity:** Next, it asserts that the linear map induced by `e`, denoted by `e.toLinearMap`, is surjective. Surjectivity here means that for every element in the target module, there is at least one element in the source module that maps to it. This property is crucial because it guarantees the coverage of the entire target space by the map, which is essential for the subsequent argument.\n\n3. **Using Surjectivity to Simplify:** The core of the proof uses a lemma or a known result, `cancel_right`, which leverages the surjectivity of `e.toLinearMap` to relate the traces of the transpose and the original module. The application of `cancel_right` effectively reduces the problem to showing that a certain condition holds after applying the surjective map, which simplifies the demonstration of the equality of traces.\n\n4. **Final Verification via Extensionality:** The proof concludes by explicitly verifying the condition for equality of traces through extensionality, which involves checking that the traces agree for all possible inputs (denoted by `f` and `m` for elements of the module and its dual, respectively). The use of `simp [e]` suggests a simplification step that applies the definitions and properties encapsulated by `e` to show that both sides of the equation indeed produce the same result for any `f` and `m`, thus establishing the equality of the traces.\n\nIn summary, the proof demonstrates that the operation of taking the trace of a module and its dual transpose module yields the same result, leveraging an equivalence between the tensor product of the module's dual and the module itself, and employing a combination of surjectivity and extensionality to establish the desired equality.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

A balanced category is one where certain conditions of duality and equivalence are met, ensuring a harmonious interplay between morphisms (the arrows or functions connecting objects in the category).\n\nThe concept of a \"separator\" (or \"separator object\") in this context refers to an object in the category that has a specific distinguishing capability: it can separate morphisms, meaning that if two morphisms with a common target are distinct, there exists at least one morphism from the separator to the target that can distinguish between them.\n\nA \"detector,\" on the other hand, is related but focuses more on detecting isomorphisms. Specifically, an object is a detector if, for any morphism that it detects as an isomorphism (meaning, intuitively, that the morphism has an inverse), the morphism indeed must be an isomorphism.\n\nThe proof leverages the lemma `IsSeparating.isDetecting` to show that the qualities defining a separator inherently satisfy the criteria for being a detector within the same mathematical framework. This lemma essentially encapsulates the logical leap from the capacity to separate morphisms to the ability to detect isomorphisms under the conditions given (namely, within a balanced category and with 'G' being the object in question).\n\nIn natural language, the theorem asserts that within a balanced category, any object that can distinguish between distinct morphisms pointing to the same target (that is, act as a separator) also has the capability to identify isomorphisms accurately, thereby acting as a detector. The proof, while concise in its Lean4 syntax, fundamentally relies on established properties and definitions in category theory to bridge the concepts of separating and detecting within this abstract mathematical landscape.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In simpler terms, this theorem is affirming that two ways of describing the open interval between two points, `a` and `b`, in the context of set `\\(\\alpha\\)` are exactly the same.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof leverages a strategy of demonstrating set equivalence by focusing on membership. In set theory, to show that two sets are equal, one approach is to prove that any element belonging to one set also belongs to the other set and vice versa. The proof employs `Set.ext`, a common method in formal verification, which asserts that two sets are equal if they have the same elements. Here, `Set.ext` is applied to an anonymous function `fun _ => mem_Ioo`, which checks for membership within the open interval `(a, b)`.\n\nThe `mem_Ioo` part of the proof essentially verifies that for any element in the set, the condition to be in the open interval between `a` and `b` (that is, greater than `a` and less than `b`) must be satisfied.

This definition demands the satisfaction of three conditions:\n\n1. **Injectivity of `Sum.inr`**: The function must be injective, meaning that no two different elements in the domain (\u03b2) can map to the same element in the codomain (`\u03b1 \u2295 \u03b2`). This condition is met by `Sum.inr_injective`, confirming that `Sum.inr` is injective.\n\n2. **Uniform Continuity of `Sum.inr`**: The function must be uniformly continuous. Uniform continuity here means that the function's mapping preserves the uniformity structure from the domain to the codomain. The condition is satisfied by `uniformContinuous_inr`, indicating that `Sum.inr` is uniformly continuous.\n\n3. **Reverse Image Preservation of Uniformity**: For any uniformly entourage (a set defining closeness in uniform spaces) in the codomain, its preimage under the function should also be a uniformly entourage in the domain. This condition is proven by constructing a specific set that contains the range of the function applied to pairs of elements from the domain, mapped separately to the left and right parts of the sum type, and showing that for any given entourage `s` in the domain, this construction meets the requirements for being a uniformly entourage in the codomain.\n\nThe proof concludes by demonstrating that these three conditions hold, thus establishing that `Sum.inr` is indeed a uniform embedding according to the given definition in Lean4's framework for uniform spaces.

The lemma used is likely named `natCast_lt_top`, which guarantees that the typecast value of any natural number is always less than \u22a4 in the `PartENat` type.\n\nThe core logical step in the proof is the application of a basic principle in order theory or logic: if a value `a` is strictly less than another value `b`, then `a` cannot be equal to `b`. Applying this principle, since `natCast_lt_top x` shows that `(x : PartENat)` is less than `\u22a4`, it follows directly that `(x : PartENat)` cannot be equal to `\u22a4`. This conclusion is formalized through the use of a function or a theorem possibly named `ne_of_lt`, which takes the inequality as input and deduces the non-equality. \n\nIn summary, the proof logically deduces that the typecast of any natural number `x` to `PartENat` cannot result in the infinity symbol (\u22a4), by leveraging the strict inequality with \u22a4 established for any such typecast number. This demonstrates a fundamental property of the typecasting operation from natural numbers to this partially defined natural numbers type, ensuring that such an operation preserves the finiteness of the natural numbers.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This is our given condition.\n\n2. **Objective**: We need to prove that under this assumption, `a < b - c` holds true.\n\n3. **Understanding the Relationship**: The statement `a + c < b` can be intuitively understood as saying that if you add `c` to `a`, the result is still not enough to reach `b`. This implies that `a` by itself must be even less in comparison to `b` when `c` is subtracted from `b`. This is because subtracting `c` from `b` makes `b` smaller, and since `a + c` was already less than `b`, `a` must be less than `b - c`.\n\n4. **Formal Reasoning (Abstracted in Lean4)**: In a formal proof, one would typically manipulate the inequality `a + c < b` to isolate `a` on one side, aiming to show it is less than `b - c`. This might involve properties of addition and subtraction, the transitive property of inequalities, and the cancellation laws for addition. However, the specific steps are abstracted away in the reference to `Contravariant.AddLECancellable.lt_tsub_of_add_lt_right`, which implies that within the Lean4 library, there's a defined behavior or property related to cancellable addition that makes this theorem hold.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Given the assumption and through logical reasoning (and leveraging the properties encapsulated in the Lean4 library), we conclude that `a` must indeed be less than `b - c`.

This implies that the series obtained after changing its origin to \\(k\\) converges within the same radius \\(r\\), thereby proving the original statement. Here are the detailed steps adapted from the Lean4 syntax to natural language:\n\n1. **Begin with an assumption:** Start by assuming that there exists a real number \\(r\\) (denoted by \\(\\_r\\) in the syntax) such that \\(r\\) is less than the radius of convergence of the original series \\(p\\). This is a common technique in mathematical proofs, where you begin with an assumption that allows you to explore the implications of that assumption.\n\n2. **Apply a lemma or result:** The proof then invokes a specific lemma or result (possibly encapsulated by `le_radius_of_summable_nnnorm`), which states that if a series is summable within a radius, then that radius is less than or equal to the radius of convergence of the series. The summability of the series after changing its origin is demonstrated by `(p.changeOriginSeries_summable_aux\u2083 hr k)`, which effectively shows that for any chosen radius \\(r\\) smaller than the original series' radius of convergence, the changed series also converges.\n\n3. **Conclude the proof:** By showing that for every \\(r\\) less than the radius of convergence of \\(p\\), the series obtained after changing its origin (denoted by `p.changeOriginSeries k`) also converges, the proof concludes that the radius of convergence of \\(p\\) is less than or equal to the radius of convergence of the series obtained after changing its origin.\n\nIn essence, the proof methodically demonstrates that changing the origin of a power series to a new point \\(k\\) does not decrease its radius of convergence.

In the context of this theorem, being disjoint is defined from the perspective of the set `s` being disjoint from set `t`. This simplification process involves focusing on the condition that for the sets to be disjoint, there must not exist an element that is both in set `s` and in set `t`. This is equivalent to saying that for every element `a` in set `s`, and for every element `b` in set `t`, it must hold that `a` is not equal to `b`.\n\nThe proof strategy involves using logical equivalences to transform the initial statement into a form that directly reflects the definition of disjoint sets. Specifically, it employs the simplification rules that are part of the Lean4 theorem prover's library to unfold the definition of `disjoint` into a form that can be directly reasoned about. The `simp only` command is used to apply only specific simplification rules that unfold the definition of being disjoint (`disjoint_left`) into a form that involves logical negation (`imp_not_comm`) and quantification over the elements of the sets (`forall_eq'`).\n\nThe `imp_not_comm` rule is used to switch the implication and negation, making it clearer that for any element `a` from set `s` and any element `b` from set `t`, `a` cannot be equal to `b`. This directly reflects the intuitive understanding of what it means for sets to be disjoint: there is no element that both sets have in common.\n\nIn summary, the proof demonstrates that the initial statement about the disjointness of two sets is equivalent to the condition that no element in one set is equal to any element in the other set.

The statement, or theorem, asserts that for any finite set (`s`) of elements of type `\u03b1`, if `\u03b1` is a subsingleton, then the number of elements (`card`) in `s` is less than or equal to one.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof employs a key principle from the Lean4 theorem prover related to finite sets, specifically the `Finset.card_le_one_iff` lemma. This lemma essentially states that a finite set has a cardinality (number of elements) less than or equal to one if and only if a certain condition holds for any two elements in the set. This condition is that for any two elements you pick from the set, those two elements must actually be the same element (which directly implies the set can have at most one unique element).\n\nIn the proof of our theorem, this condition is satisfied by invoking the `Subsingleton.elim` function. `Subsingleton.elim` is a special function in the context of types that are subsingletons. It guarantees that any two elements of such a type are indeed the same element. This property is what makes the `if and only if` condition of the `Finset.card_le_one_iff` lemma true.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the proof first assumes that `\u03b1` is a subsingleton. Then, for any finite set `s` of elements of type `\u03b1`, it applies the lemma `Finset.card_le_one_iff`. According to this lemma, to prove that the cardinality of `s` is less than or equal to one, one needs to prove that any two elements in `s` are actually the same element.

In simpler terms, if you have a set of points and you first take the neighborhood filter of each point and then the infimum of those filters, it's the same as taking the infimum of the set of points first and then the neighborhood filter of that.\n\nThe proof, therefore, relies on the general principle (captured by `Monotone.of_map_inf`) that if a certain condition involving infimums is met (as specified by `nhds_inf`), then the function in question is monotone. By applying this principle to the specific case of neighborhood filters, the theorem concludes that the mapping from filters to their neighborhood filters is indeed monotone.\n\nIn essence, the proof does not go through the detailed steps of showing monotonicity directly but rather invokes a higher-level principle that, given certain conditions, guarantees monotonicity. This approach is common in formal verification and theorem proving, where complex properties can be established by composing simpler, already proven facts.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In simpler terms, it's about proving that there exists a computable function that, given a natural number `n`, returns its predecessor (the number that comes before `n`) if `n` is not zero, and is undefined (or does not return a result) if `n` is zero. This concept is fundamental in the theory of computation, illustrating how certain basic functions can be computed or not computed based on their definitions.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof utilizes the machinery of primitive recursive functions, a class of functions that are basic enough to be computed directly. It's structured in several steps:\n\n1. **Construction of a Primitive Recursive Selector:** The proof begins by defining a primitive recursive function that takes two natural numbers `n` and `m` as inputs. It returns `0` if `n` is the successor of `m` (i.e., `n = m + 1`), and `1` otherwise. This is accomplished using an if-else condition within the framework of primitive recursive functions, exploiting their ability to encode basic decision-making processes.\n\n2. **Application of `rfind`:** The core of the proof involves transforming the above decision function into a partial function that looks for the smallest `m` such that `n = m + 1`. This is achieved by applying the `rfind` operator, which searches for the least number `m` making the decision function return `0`. If such an `m` exists, `ppred n` is defined (and equals `m`); if not, `ppred n` is undefined. This reflects the behavior of the partial predecessor function: it finds the predecessor of `n` if `n` is not zero, and fails to return a value if `n` is zero.\n\n3. **Case Analysis:** The proof concludes with a case analysis on `n`. \n   - For `n = 0`, the function is shown to be undefined because there is no `m` such that `0 = m + 1`. This is demonstrated by contradiction: assuming there exists such an `m` leads to a logical inconsistency.\n   - For `n > 0` (expressed as `n = Nat.succ m` for some `m`), the proof shows that the function indeed returns a value, specifically `m`, because `n` is the successor of `m` by definition, and thus `m` is the predecessor of `n`.\n\nThroughout, the proof adheres to the principles of formal verification, precisely demonstrating each step's correctness within the Lean4 theorem prover's logic framework.

This implies that the function extends beyond the inner radius up to the outer radius, ensuring that the area of effect or influence of the `ContDiffBump` function is not just a single point but has a positive extent.\n\nGiven these two properties, the proof combines them by a transitive argument:\n\n- Since `rIn` is positive (`rIn > 0` from the first property),\n- And `rIn` is less than `rOut` (`rIn < rOut` from the second property),\n- It logically follows that `rOut` must also be greater than zero (`0 < rOut`).\n\nThis proof structure is quite common in mathematics, where the properties of mathematical objects are deduced from known or previously proven attributes, following a logical progression that ensures the conclusions are sound and based on established premises.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The `exact` keyword in Lean4 is used to indicate that the following expression or theorem precisely resolves the current goal or statement being proved.

The \"measure\" of a set quantifies its size, and a measure of zero suggests the set contains no \"space\".\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem proceeds directly from the properties of open sets and the definition of measure in a given space.\n\n1. The theorem begins with two assumptions: first, that \\(U\\) is an open set (\\(hU : IsOpen U\\)), and second, that the measure of \\(U\\) is zero (\\(h\u2080 : \u03bc U = 0\\)).\n\n2.

This property says that for an open set \\(U\\), the condition that \\(U\\) has a measure of zero is equivalent to \\(U\\) being empty. This equivalence is accessed via \\((hU.measure_eq_zero_iff \u03bc)\\), which translates to \"for the open set \\(U\\), having a measure of zero according to measure \\(\u03bc\\) is equivalent to being empty.\"\n\n3.

These rewrites are essential for aligning the statement derived from `mem_span_singleton'` with the exact form needed to conclude that \\(x \\in \\text{span}(\\{y\\}) \\iff y \\mid x\\).\n\n4. **Conclusion:** By applying these steps, the proof effectively shows that for \\(x\\) to be in the span of the singleton set containing \\(y\\), it is necessary and sufficient that \\(y\\) divides \\(x\\). This is achieved by transforming a base statement through logical and algebraic manipulations that preserve the truth value, ultimately arriving at the desired equivalence.\n\nIn summary, the proof leverages a combination of a foundational lemma (`mem_span_singleton'`), existential quantifier manipulation, and commutative properties of equality and multiplication to demonstrate the equivalence between \\(x\\) being in the span of \\(\\{y\\}\\) and \\(y\\) dividing \\(x\\). This logical flow from a base assertion through targeted manipulations to the final equivalence captures the essence of the theorem's statement and its proof within the algebraic framework.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

A basis for a filter is a collection of sets such that every set in the filter contains one of these basis sets.

The first part of the refinement involves showing that for every `x` in the extended real numbers, if `x` is less than infinity, then there exists a set in the basis that is a subset of the intervals greater than `x`.

In essence, it states that a constant stream generated with an element is the same as a stream with that element followed by a constant stream of the same element.\n\n# Proof:\n1. **Approach**: We start by applying a function named `Stream'.ext` which allows us to prove the equality of two streams by showing that their corresponding elements at any index `n` are equal. This is a common approach in functional programming and theorem proving for dealing with infinite structures like streams.\n   \n2. **Case Analysis**: The proof proceeds by considering all possible cases for `n`, the index at which we are comparing the elements of the two streams. Since `n` is a natural number, the smallest case is when `n = 0`, and then it increments by 1 for each subsequent case. However, the specific syntax used (`cases n <;> rfl`) is a shorthand in Lean4 that automatically handles these cases. It effectively means \"for each case, the result follows by reflexivity (`rfl`)\", which in proof terms means \"the two sides of the equation are identically the same\".\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The reflexivity (`rfl`) used in each case indicates that, for any index `n`, the `n`-th element of both streams (`const a` and `a::const a`) is the same, which is the element `a`. This concludes the proof by showing that at every position in the stream, the two sides of the equality are identical, thus proving that `const a = a::const a`.\n\nThis proof leverages the principle of extensionality for streams, which states that two streams are equal if they are element-wise equal at every index.

That is, for any two sets `A` and `B`, the symmetric difference `A \u2206 B` is equal to `B \u2206 A`. Applying this to our case, we get `\u22a5 \u2206 a = a \u2206 \u22a5`.\n\n2. **Use the Property of Bottom Element with Symmetric Difference**: The next step uses a specific property of the symmetric difference when one of the operands is the bottom element (`\u22a5`). The bottom element here represents the empty set or a similar identity element for the symmetric difference operation in the given context.

This is a topological way of saying that moving from `a` towards `b` keeps us within a neighborhood of `a`.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: By combining these steps, we conclude that the neighborhood of `a` within the open interval `(a, b)` (`\ud835\udcdd[Ioo a b] a`) is indeed equal to the neighborhood of `a` restricted to elements greater than `a` (`\ud835\udcdd[>] a`).

In simpler terms, the collection of sets that approximate the point at infinity closely enough cannot be described by a countable set of sets.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof proceeds by contradiction, aiming to show that if we assumed the neighborhood filter of infinity to be countably generated, we would arrive at a contradiction.\n\n1. **Introduction**: The proof begins by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove, that is, there exists a countable basis for the neighborhood filter of infinity in the Alexandroff one-point compactification of the rational numbers.\n\n2. **Utilizing the `comap` function**: The proof then considers the `comap` (the preimage under a certain function, in this case, `OnePoint.some`, which maps from \u211a to \u211a\u221e) of the neighborhood filter of \u221e. It states that this `comap` is also countably generated, which is derived from our initial assumption by automatic inference in Lean4.\n\n3. **Rewriting using properties of `OnePoint` and compactness**: Next, the proof employs a rewriting step to replace the expression involving the `comap` of the neighborhood filter with an expression involving coclosed compact sets.

This is done by considering the union of the singleton set containing `b` and the set `Ico a b`.\n   \n   - **Step 2**: Next, apply the commutative property of set union, which allows us to swap the sets in the union operation without changing the result. This step doesn't alter the mathematical substance but prepares for the next logical step by rearranging the components in a way that aligns with available lemmas or properties.\n   \n   - **Step 3**: Now, utilize the property or lemma that states when you have the set of integers from `a` to `b` exclusive of `b` (`Ico a b`) and you union this with the set containing just `b`, under the condition that `a` is less than or equal to `b`, you get the set of integers from `a` to `b` inclusive (`Icc a b`).

This theorem essentially states that increasing the step limit for a computation does not lose any results that were obtainable with a smaller step limit.\n\n# Proof: \nThe proof proceeds by induction on the structure of the computation `c` and the step limits `k\u2081` and `k\u2082`.\n\n1. **Base Case**: When `k\u2081` is 0, the proof uses simplification to show that if `x` is in the result of the computation with 0 steps, it cannot be in the result of the computation with more steps, as the computation with 0 steps does not produce any result. This is a straightforward case handled by the definition of `evaln`.\n\n2. **Inductive Step**: For the case where both `k\u2081` and `k\u2082` are incremented by 1 (from `k` to `k + 1` and `k\u2082` to `k\u2082 + 1` respectively), the proof first establishes that `k \u2264 k\u2082` by the property of natural numbers. Then, it sets up a general lemma that if `x` is in the result of a computation with a certain step limit, and if increasing the step limit does not change the outcome of a computation (`o\u2081` to `o\u2082`), then `x` will be in the result of the computation with the increased step limit. This lemma is proven by simplification and logical reasoning about the properties of the `Option` type and the `guard` function in Lean.\n\n3. The proof then proceeds to handle the different forms of computation (`c`)\u2014pair, composition, primitive recursion, and the find operator (`rfind'`). For each of these, it uses the induction hypothesis and the lemma established earlier to show that if `x` is in the result of the computation with a smaller step limit, it will also be in the result with a larger step limit. The handling of these cases involves:\n   - Simplifying the definitions of the computations.\n   - Applying the induction hypothesis to the components of the computations.\n   - Using logical reasoning to show that the conditions for including `x` in the result set are maintained or expanded when the step limit is increased.\n\n4. **Special Cases**: \n   - For the pair computation, it shows that if `x` is the result of sequencing two computations, then increasing the step limit maintains the result.\n   - For the composition, it demonstrates that if `x` is the result of composing two computations, then the result is maintained with a higher step limit.\n   - For primitive recursion, it uses induction on the parameter `n` to show that the result is maintained across step limits.\n   - For the find operator, it shows that if `x` is found within the step limit, then it will also be found with a higher step limit, considering the specific behavior of the find operation.\n\nIn summary, the proof methodically demonstrates that increasing the step limit for a computation does not exclude any results that could be obtained with a smaller step limit, by induction on the structure of the computation and the step limits, and by logical reasoning about the behavior of computations and the properties of the `Option` type in Lean.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Specifically, for any fixed group element \\(a\\), the functions \\(x \\mapsto a \\cdot x\\) (left multiplication by \\(a\\)) and \\(x \\mapsto x \\cdot a\\) (right multiplication by \\(a\\)) are continuous.\n\nGiven an element \\(g\\) in the topological group \\(G\\), we want to show that the function \\(f: G \\to G\\) defined by \\(f(h) = g \\cdot h \\cdot g^{-1}\\) is continuous. The proof proceeds as follows:\n\n- First, consider the function \\(f_1: G \\to G\\) defined by \\(f_1(h) = h \\cdot g^{-1}\\). This is a right multiplication by \\(g^{-1}\\), which is continuous by the continuity of group operations. Thus, \\(f_1\\) is continuous.\n\n- Next, consider the function \\(f_2: G \\to G\\) defined by \\(f_2(h) = g \\cdot h\\). This is a left multiplication by \\(g\\), which is also continuous by the continuity of group operations. Thus, \\(f_2\\) is continuous.\n\n- The function \\(f\\) we are interested in can be expressed as the composition of \\(f_2\\) and \\(f_1\\), that is, \\(f = f_2 \\circ f_1\\). Since \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) are both continuous, and the composition of continuous functions is continuous, it follows that \\(f\\) is continuous.\n\nThis completes the proof that conjugation by any element in a topological group is a continuous function.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Specifically, it concerns a set `s` of elements of type `\u03b1` and an element `a` of the same type. The condition to be met is that `a` must be an upper bound of the set `s`. Being an upper bound means that for every element `x` in `s`, `x \u2264 a` holds true.\n\n2. **Assertion and Logic:** The theorem asserts that under the condition where `a` is an upper bound of `s`, the supremum (`sSup`) of `s` is less than or equal to `a`. The supremum of a set is the least element that is greater than or equal to every element in the set. In simpler terms, it's the smallest of the upper bounds.\n\n3. **Proof Mechanism:** The proof utilizes the lemma `csSup_le_iff'`, which likely provides a condition (in the form of an if-and-only-if statement) under which the supremum of a set is less than or equal to an element `a`. The construct `\u27e8a, h\u27e9` is creating a pair consisting of `a` and the hypothesis `h` (the assumption that `a` is an upper bound of `s`).

This lemma is about the membership condition of elements in the result of the \"star\" operation within some set, specifically addressing how an element relates to the \"star\" of a set under some conditions. The `.symm` indicates the use of the symmetric (or reverse) form of the lemma, essentially flipping the direction of an equivalence or implication.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The proof concludes by showing that, given the logical steps and transformations applied, the theorem that `\u03c3 (star a) = star (\u03c3 a)` holds true under the conditions and definitions provided.

This is because for a seminorm, \\(p(x) = 0\\) only if \\(x = 0\\), but since \\(p(1) = 1\\), \\(1\\) clearly cannot be \\(0\\).\n\n2. **Second Part (\\(p \\neq 0 \\implies p(1) = 1\\))**: Here, the strategy involves proving by contradiction. The proof begins by assuming there exists a scenario where \\(p\\) is not zero yet does not satisfy \\(p(1) = 1\\). We consider two cases based on the value of \\(p(1)\\): it is either \\(0\\) or greater than \\(0\\). \n   \n   - **Case 1 (\\(p(1) = 0\\))**: This leads to a contradiction immediately because, by our assumption, \\(p\\) is not the zero function, but \\(p(1) = 0\\) would imply that \\(p\\) behaves like a zero function at \\(1\\), which contradicts the seminorm properties.\n   \n   - **Case 2 (\\(p(1) > 0\\))**: In this case, the proof uses the property of seminorms that relates the seminorm of a product to the product of seminorms, and through logical deductions involving inequalities and the assumption that \\(p(1) \\leq 1\\), it concludes that \\(p(1)\\) must indeed equal \\(1\\). This involves showing that any value of \\(p(1)\\) that does not equal \\(1\\) contradicts the initial conditions or properties of a seminorm, thus proving the statement.\n\nThroughout the proof, various properties of seminorms and logical reasoning techniques are employed, such as direct proof, proof by contradiction, and the examination of cases. The proof concludes that the only way for all conditions to be satisfied is if \\(p(1) = 1\\) exactly when \\(p\\) is not the zero function, which completes the proof of the theorem.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This means that if two algebra homomorphisms from `A` to `B` over a ring `R` are considered equal when cast to ring homomorphisms, then they were originally equal as algebra homomorphisms.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof utilizes the property of function injectivity and a specific instance of function coercion (casting). To demonstrate the injectivity of the function that casts an algebra homomorphism to a ring homomorphism, we take two algebra homomorphisms, `\u03c6\u2081` and `\u03c6\u2082`, from `A` to `B`. \n\n1. We assume that these two functions, when cast to ring homomorphisms (`A \u2192+* B`), are equal. This is represented by the assumption `H` in the proof.\n\n2. To prove injectivity, we must show that under this assumption, `\u03c6\u2081` and `\u03c6\u2082` are equal as algebra homomorphisms. \n\n3. The proof proceeds by using the `congr_arg` function on `H`, which allows us to deduce that the functions are equal in their action from `A` to `B` when viewed as regular functions (`A \u2192 B`). \n\n4. Finally, `coe_fn_injective` is applied, which is a lemma stating that if two functions are equal in their coerced form (`A \u2192 B`), then the original functions (in this case, the algebra homomorphisms `\u03c6\u2081` and `\u03c6\u2082`) are equal. This leverages the injectivity of the coercion from an algebra homomorphism to its underlying function representation.\n\nIn conclusion, by showing that the equality of the cast functions implies the equality of the algebra homomorphisms themselves, we have proven the injectivity of the casting function. The argument hinges on the fundamental principle that if two entities produce the same output under a certain operation or transformation (in this case, coercion to a ring homomorphism and further to a function from `A` to `B`), and if this operation is injective (meaning no two distinct inputs produce the same output), then the original entities must be identical.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Specifically, it states that for any element `x` of type \u03b2 and any two sets `V` and `W` of pairs of type \u03b2, the ball centered at `x` with radius `(V \u2229 W)` (the intersection of V and W) is a subset of the ball centered at `x` with radius `W`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem relies on a fundamental property of set theory, particularly on the behavior of intersections and subsets. Here's a step-by-step explanation in natural language, mirroring the logical structure of the Lean4 proof:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We are given an element `x` of type \u03b2 and two sets of pairs, `V` and `W`, also of type \u03b2. We aim to show that the set of elements that are within a certain \"distance\" (metaphorically speaking, as defined by the sets `V` and `W`) from `x` in the intersection `V \u2229 W` is also within that \"distance\" from `x` in `W`.\n\n2. **Use of `ball_mono`**: The proof utilizes a lemma or a previously proven fact named `ball_mono`. This fact states that if one set is a subset of another, then the ball around a point `x` with the first set as its \"radius\" is a subset of the ball around the same point `x` with the second set as its \"radius\". In simpler terms, if you have two sets, and one is entirely contained within the other, then everything within a certain \"distance\" from `x` in the smaller set is also within that \"distance\" from `x` in the larger set.\n\n3. **Applying `inter_subset_right`**: To apply `ball_mono`, we need to establish that one set is a subset of the other. This is where `inter_subset_right` comes into play. It is a principle that states the right set in an intersection (in this case, `W` in `V \u2229 W`) always contains the intersection itself. This makes intuitive sense because the intersection of two sets can only contain elements that are in both sets, so it is naturally a subset of each.\n\n4. **Concluding the Proof**: By applying `inter_subset_right`, we establish that `(V \u2229 W)` is a subset of `W`. Then, invoking `ball_mono` with this subset relationship and the point `x`, we conclude that the ball around `x` with radius `(V \u2229 W)` is indeed a subset of the ball around `x` with radius `W`. This completes the proof.\n\nIn summary, the theorem and its proof demonstrate a specific relationship between sets and their intersections in the context of \"balls\" around points in a set, using principles of subset relationships and the properties of intersections.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This is direct application of the assumption that `l\u2082` is a subset of `l\u2083`.\n   - Then, it applies `mem_of_subset' h\u2081 m\u2081` to argue that because `m\u2081` (an element of `l\u2081`) is a member of `l\u2082` (by virtue of `l\u2081` being a subset of `l\u2082`), and since any member of `l\u2082` is a member of `l\u2083`, `m\u2081` is also a member of `l\u2083`.\n\nThe logical flow from assuming subset relationships (`h\u2081` and `h\u2082`), through applying a definition of subset that focuses on element membership (`subset_def.2`), to concluding that elements of the first list must be elements of the third list (by chaining the element's membership from the first list to the second, and from the second to the third), embodies the proof of the transitive property of subset relations among lists.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

You've mentioned Lean4, which is a theorem proving software, and Isabelle, which is another theorem proving tool. However, the syntax you provided seems to be more in line with Lean's syntax rather than Isabelle's. Regardless, let's dive into the core of your request: translating a Lean4 theorem statement and its proof into plain English, focusing on the theorem named `strictMono_comp_ofDual_iff`.\n\n# Statement:\nThe theorem `strictMono_comp_ofDual_iff` can be translated to the following natural language statement:\n\n\"The composition of a function `f` with the `ofDual` function is strictly monotonic if and only if `f` is strictly antitonic.\"\n\nIn simpler terms, this theorem is about understanding the relationship between two properties of functions. A function is \"strictly monotonic\" if it preserves the order strictly (i.e., if `a < b`, then `f(a) < f(b)` for all `a` and `b`), and it's \"strictly antitonic\" if it reverses the order strictly (i.e., if `a < b`, then `f(a) > f(b)` for all `a` and `b`). The `ofDual` function is a bit more specific and requires understanding the context in which it's defined, but generally, it involves some form of inversion or duality principle.\n\nTranslating this into a natural language explanation would require inferring a bit about the content of the proof since the actual logical steps aren't detailed here. Generally, a proof of an \"if and only if\" statement involves proving two directions:\n\n1. **First Direction (\u21d2):** If the composition `f \u2218 ofDual` is strictly monotonic, then `f` must be strictly antitonic. This would involve showing that the strict increase (or decrease, depending on the exact nature of `ofDual`) in the outputs of the composition implies a strict decrease in the outputs of `f` when its inputs are ordered.\n\n2. **Second Direction (\u21d0):** If `f` is strictly antitonic, then the composition `f \u2218 ofDual` is strictly monotonic. Here, one would demonstrate that reversing the order of inputs by `f` (due to it being strictly antitonic) is somehow corrected or maintained by the composition with `ofDual`, resulting in a strict monotonic behavior.\n\nThe `forall_swap` hint suggests that the proof might involve swapping the order of quantifiers or elements to facilitate the demonstration of these properties, highlighting the symmetric nature of the \"if and only if\" relationship in this context.\n\nWithout more specific details on the functions and the logical steps taken in the proof, this is as close to a translation and explanation as we can get based on the information provided.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This is a result or assumption not shown in detail here but is accepted as a given part of the proof (likely a lemma or a known property).\n\n2. **Existence of a Non-zero Vector**: The hypothesis (\\(h\\)) given is that there exists a non-zero vector \\(x\\) in \\(V\\) such that its norm is not zero. This is the mathematical notation for saying, \"there is at least one vector \\(x\\) in \\(V\\) for which the norm \\(\\|x\\|\\) is not equal to 0.\"\n\n3. **Leveraging the Non-zero Vector**: Using this non-zero vector \\(x\\), the proof next focuses on showing the lower bound for the norm of the identity function. It considers the operation of the identity function on \\(x\\) and relates it to the norm of the identity function through the property that the ratio of the norm of \\(x\\) (after being transformed by the identity function, which does nothing to \\(x\\)) to the norm of \\(x\\) itself is less than or equal to the norm of the identity function.\n\n4. **Application of the Identity Function**: It directly applies the identity function to \\(x\\) (\\(id V x = x\\)) and observes that since \\(x\\) is non-zero (as per \\(hx\\)), the division of \\(\\|x\\|\\) by itself (\\(\\frac{\\|x\\|}{\\|x\\|}\\)) is 1.\n\n5. **Conclusion by Antisymmetry**: The proof concludes by applying the principle of antisymmetry (le_antisymm), which in this context, means that if the norm of the identity function is both less than or equal to 1 and at least 1 (due to the argument about the non-zero vector), it must precisely be 1. The upper bound was established in step 1, and the argument around the non-zero vector establishes the lower bound, completing the proof.\n\nIn simpler terms, this proof demonstrates that if there's at least one vector in \\(V\\) that doesn't collapse to zero under the norm, then operating by identity (doing nothing to each vector) scales vectors in a way that the most significant possible scaling factor is exactly 1, reflecting the untouched nature of vectors under identity.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Therefore, the condition for strict convexity, which involves checking all pairs of distinct points, is trivially satisfied because there are no such pairs to check.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since the condition for strict convexity is vacuously true for an empty set (due to the absence of any points), we conclude that an empty set is strictly convex.\n\nThe proof leverages a logical principle known as vacuous truth. A statement that depends on elements of an empty set is considered true because there are no counterexamples within the set; there are no elements at all. In this context, the strict convexity condition has no opportunity to fail because it applies to a situation (pairs of distinct points in the set) that does not exist in an empty set.\n\nThus, the theorem \"strictConvex_empty\" succinctly captures the idea that the absence of elements in an empty set makes it comply with the strict convexity condition by default, completing the proof.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Extended real numbers include all real numbers plus two symbolic values: positive infinity (\u221e) and negative infinity (-\u221e).\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof leverages a theorem from a mathematical library (indicated by `WithTop.le_of_add_le_add_right` and the alignment tags with `ennreal.le_of_add_le_add_right` and `ENNReal.le_of_add_le_add_right`), which is specialized in handling operations with extended real numbers (`ennreal` stands for extended non-negative reals, and `ENNReal` seems to be a similar context or a typographical variation meant to indicate the same).\n\nThe core logical flow of the proof can be described as follows:\n\n1. **Assumption**: It starts with two key assumptions:\n   - `a \u2260 \u221e`: The value `a` is not infinity, ensuring that the addition involving `a` does not lead to automatic inequalities due to the presence of infinity.\n   - `b + a \u2264 c + a`: The sum of `b` and `a` is less than or equal to the sum of `c` and `a`.

This pre-existing theorem essentially states that if you have two sums that are equal or one is greater, and if one of the operands in both sums is the same and not infinity, then the other operands can be compared directly.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Given the assumptions and the application of the existing theorem, the conclusion is that `b \u2264 c`. This follows logically because the influence of `a` is neutralized by it being the same in both sums and not infinity, allowing a direct comparison of `b` and `c`.\n\nIn natural language, this theorem and its proof articulate a fundamental principle of comparison: if adding the same non-infinite quantity to two values doesn't change their relative ordering, then the values themselves maintain that ordering.

The theorem asserts that when this product type is coerced (or converted) into a function, that function is equivalent to taking the second component of a pair (which is what `Prod.snd` does).\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is given by `rfl`, which stands for \"reflexivity\". In the context of Lean4 and many other theorem provers, `rfl` is used to indicate that the statement can be proven by observing that both sides of the equation are exactly the same by definition. In this case, the definition of the coercion function of `punitProd \u03b1` directly yields `Prod.snd` as its behavior, meaning that by the way `punitProd \u03b1` is defined, it is clear and self-evident that its coercion to a function results in a function that takes a pair and returns its second component. Therefore, the proof does not require any steps other than recognizing this inherent equality based on definitions and the structure of the types involved.\n\nIn summary, the theorem asserts a fundamental property about how a specific product type behaves when converted into a function, and its proof relies on the direct observation that this behavior is exactly as stated, without the need for further logical deduction or evidence.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Specifically, we use the fact that the logarithm of 0 is not defined in the real numbers under conventional definitions, but the comparison leans towards acknowledging that if we could define it, it would fit the narrative of being less than or equal to 0 since log(1) = 0 and log(x) for x < 1 would be negative.\n   - Additionally, we observe the simple fact that 0 is indeed less than or equal to 1. So, this case simplistically supports the theorem through the understanding of basic mathematical properties, even though the log(0) scenario is a bit of a special case in mathematics.\n\n2. **Case 2 (x > 0):** \n   - In this scenario, we invoke a more general lemma or theorem, presumably proven elsewhere, that directly relates to the condition of the logarithm of a number being non-positive.

In mathematical terms, this can be interpreted as dividing the interval from `a` to `b` into segments of length `p` and then counting how many such full segments fit into this interval, disregarding any partial segment at the end.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof employs a refinement strategy that directly relates the `toIcoDiv` function to properties of integer division and inequalities within intervals. It proceeds as follows:\n\n1. **Refinement using `toIcoDiv_eq_of_sub_zsmul_mem_Ico`**: This step establishes a direct connection between the `toIcoDiv` function and the notion of an integer multiple (`zsmul`) being within an interval. Essentially, it sets the stage for interpreting the division as counting how many times `p` can be subtractively fit into the interval from `a` to `b`.\n\n2. **Rewriting with properties of intervals and integer multiplication**: The statement inside the interval `Set.mem_Ico` is manipulated using algebraic identities and properties of inequalities. This involves:\n   - Recognizing that `zsmul` (integer multiplication) can be replaced by regular multiplication.\n   - Rearranging terms to highlight the non-negativity condition (`sub_nonneg`) and the less-than condition in terms of interval bounds.\n   - Employing `sub_lt_iff_lt_add` to shift the perspective from subtraction on one side of an inequality to addition on the other, facilitating a clearer comparison between `b - a` and multiples of `p`.\n\n3. **Establishing bounds with `Int.sub_floor_div_mul_nonneg` and `Int.sub_floor_div_mul_lt`**:\n   - The first bound, `Int.sub_floor_div_mul_nonneg`, ensures that the result of our division, when adjusted for the floor function, remains non-negative. This is crucial because it aligns with the requirement that the count of full segments (or divisions) cannot be negative.\n   - The second bound, `Int.sub_floor_div_mul_lt`, asserts that the actual division result, before taking the floor, does not reach the next integer.

This is shown through extensionality, a principle which, in this context, means that to prove two homomorphisms are equal, it suffices to show that their outputs are the same for every possible input.\n\n1. **Extensionality Applied**: The proof begins with applying the principle of extensionality to our homomorphisms \\(f\\) and \\(g\\). This is denoted by `ext a`, which essentially says \"let's consider any element \\(a\\) from \\(A\\)\".\n\n2. **Applying Function Equality**: The next step involves utilizing the given equality of \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) as functions (ignoring the homomorphism structure).

This is formally captured by the `le_iInf` function and `tendsto_eval_ae_ae.le_comap`.\n\n3. **Convergence and Mapping**: The `tendsto_eval_ae_ae.le_comap` essentially says that if we look at properties that hold almost everywhere for each of the individual measures, their convergence towards being true in the product space is guaranteed. The `le_comap` part indicates a mapping from a broader filter to a more specific one, ensuring that if something holds under the filter for the product measure, it also holds under the individual measures' filters, but combined through the product operation.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the theorem concludes that the almost everywhere filter for the product measure does not impose any additional constraints beyond what is already imposed by the individual measures' almost everywhere filters when combined.

In category theory, this is a property indicating that the only subobjects of \\(Y\\) are trivial (i.e., the subobject itself and the minimal subobject).\n\n2. **Atomicity of Subobjects**: A subobject \\(Y\\) is atomic if, within the lattice of subobjects of \\(X\\), \\(Y\\) covers the bottom element directly. That is, there are no intermediate subobjects between \\(Y\\) and the least subobject of \\(X\\) (often the initial object or a zero object in the category, depending on the context).\n\nThe proof proceeds by showing the equivalence of these two notions through a series of isomorphisms and properties:\n\n- **Step 1**: It starts with the property `simple_iff_subobject_isSimpleOrder`, which establishes the equivalence between the simplicity of a subobject in the category \\(C\\) and the simplicity of the ordering of subobjects under inclusion. This sets the stage for translating the problem into one concerning order theory.\n\n- **Step 2**: The next part involves the `OrderIso.isSimpleOrder_iff` application to the `subobjectOrderIso Y`, which translates the simplicity condition in the categorical context to the simplicity condition in the order-theoretic context, specifically through the isomorphism between the lattice of subobjects of \\(X\\) and some ordered set. This step asserts that the simplicity of \\(Y\\) as a subobject is equivalent to the simplicity of the corresponding element in the ordered set.\n\n- **Step 3**: Finally, `Set.isSimpleOrder_Iic_iff_isAtom` connects the simplicity in the order-theoretic sense to atomicity within the set of subobjects.

This is deduced from the fact that a group with more than one element is nontrivial, a principle derived from `Fintype.one_lt_card_iff_nontrivial`. Specifically, the argument `lt_trans (by decide) h3` assures that the cardinality is indeed greater than 1, given it's at least 3.\n\nNext, the proof employs a rewrite tactic to substitute the statement about the group's nontriviality with its condition of having more than one element, using the reverse implication of `Fintype.one_lt_card_iff_nontrivial`. This sets the stage for demonstrating that the size of the alternating group is large enough to guarantee its nontriviality.\n\nThe crux of the proof relies on showing that twice the cardinality of the alternating group is less than the factorial of the cardinality of set \u03b1 (`two_mul_card_alternatingGroup, card_perm`).

The theorem `scanl_cons` asserts that when you apply `scanl` to a binary function `f`, an initial accumulator value `b`, and a vector created by prepending `x` to `v`, the result is a new vector starting with `b`, followed by the result of applying `scanl` to `f`, the result of applying `f` to `b` and `x` (i.e., `f b x`), and the rest of the original vector `v`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof uses the Lean4 proof assistant syntax and methodology to demonstrate the theorem.

The theorem states that if you perform a fold operation with a function `f` of type `\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2` (which takes an accumulator of type `\u03b2` and an element of type `\u03b1` and returns a new accumulator of type `\u03b2`), starting with an initial accumulator value `b`, over an empty collection, then the result of this operation is simply the initial accumulator value `b`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is given by `rfl`, which stands for \"reflexivity\". In the context of Lean4 and many other theorem provers, `rfl` is a tactic that proves statements of equality where both sides are literally the same, or their equality can be inferred directly from the definitions without any additional steps. \n\nIn this case, the use of `rfl` indicates that the statement `foldl f H b 0 = b` is true by definition of how `foldl` operates on an empty collection. The definition of `foldl` for an empty collection directly returns the initial accumulator without applying the function `f`, which makes the statement immediately true. Therefore, the proof does not require any steps other than recognizing that the result is directly given by the definition of `foldl` on an empty collection.\n\nTo elaborate, the logical structure of the proof is as follows:\n1. The `foldl` operation is defined such that when it is applied to an empty collection, it returns the initial accumulator value without any modification.\n2. Given this definition, when `foldl` is applied to an empty collection (denoted by `0`), with any function `f` and any initial accumulator `b`, it must return `b`.\n3. Therefore, by reflexivity (`rfl`), the statement `foldl f H b 0 = b` holds true, as both sides of the equality are, by definition, the same.\n\nThis proof relies entirely on the definition of the `foldl` function and the property of reflexivity in equality, demonstrating the theorem's correctness without requiring further logical or computational steps.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

A scalar tower is a setup where scalars from one algebra can be considered as scalars in another, facilitating a hierarchical scalar multiplication across the algebras. This is achieved by invoking `RestrictScalars.isScalarTower`, which asserts that \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) form a scalar tower, allowing us to manipulate scalars across these rings in a coherent manner.\n\n3. **Finite Module**: Given that the composition \\(g \\circ f\\) is finite (as per the hypothesis `h`), we interpret this to mean that \\(C\\) is a finite \\(A\\)-module via the composition.

It states that for any positive real number `\u03b5` (denoted as `{\u03b5 : \u211d}` where `0 < \u03b5`), there exists a positive modulus of continuity for the function `f`. In simpler terms, it's saying that if you pick any small positive distance `\u03b5`, you can find a small enough distance around any point in the domain of `f`, such that `f` doesn't change by more than `\u03b5` within that small distance. This is a way to formally define what it means for a function to be continuous in a mathematical sense.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem utilizes a property derived from the uniform continuity of the function `f`, which is guaranteed by the statement `(Classical.choose_spec (uniform_continuity f \u03b5 h)).1`. Here's a breakdown of the proof in natural language:\n\n1. We start with the assumption that `f` is uniformly continuous. In mathematical terms, this means for every `\u03b5 > 0`, there exists a `\u03b4 > 0` such that for all pairs of points `x` and `y` in the domain of `f`, if the distance between `x` and `y` is less than `\u03b4`, then the distance between `f(x)` and `f(y)` is less than `\u03b5`. This property is essential for the proof.\n\n2. The expression `Classical.choose_spec` refers to a classical logic principle where we can choose a specific example or instance that satisfies a given property. In this context, it's used to select a `\u03b4` that works for our given `\u03b5`, based on the uniform continuity of `f`.\n\n3. The `.1` at the end of the expression `(Classical.choose_spec (uniform_continuity f \u03b5 h)).1` indicates we're interested in the first part of the chosen specification, which in this case, would be the positive `\u03b4` that corresponds to our `\u03b5`. This is the modulus of continuity for `f` at `\u03b5`.\n\n4. The conclusion `0 < f.modulus \u03b5 h` asserts that the modulus of continuity (the `\u03b4` we found) is positive, which aligns with our intuitive understanding of continuity: there must be a non-zero 'wiggle room' or distance (`\u03b4`) around any point within which the function doesn't vary by more than the given `\u03b5`.\n\nThe lemma and its proof together formalize a fundamental aspect of continuous functions, demonstrating that for every positive distance `\u03b5`, you can always find a positive `\u03b4` (the modulus of continuity) that maintains the function's values within `\u03b5` when moving no more than `\u03b4` from any point in the function's domain.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This means that for any angle \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\cos(\\theta + 2\\pi) = \\cos(\\theta)\\). This property allows us to express the cosine of any angle that is an integer multiple of \\(2\\pi\\) as just the cosine of the angle itself, since any multiple of \\(2\\pi\\) can be thought of as completing full circles around the unit circle.\n\n2. **Addition of the Period**: Adding \\(\\pi\\) to an angle \\(\\theta\\) essentially reflects the point on the unit circle corresponding to \\(\\theta\\) across the x-axis. This is because adding \\(\\pi\\) radians (or 180 degrees) to an angle corresponds to a half-circle rotation in the unit circle. For the cosine function, which measures the x-coordinate of a point on the unit circle, this reflection changes the sign of the cosine value. Therefore, \\(\\cos(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\cos(\\theta)\\).\n\nUsing these two properties, we can prove the given statement as follows:\n\nConsider the expression \\(\\cos(n \\times (2\\pi) + \\pi)\\).\n\n- First, by the periodicity of the cosine function, we know that multiplying \\(2\\pi\\) (the period of the cosine function) by any natural number \\(n\\) and adding it to an angle does not change the cosine's value. Thus, \\(\\cos(n \\times (2\\pi) + \\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)\\) for any \\(\\theta\\).\n- Second, by adding \\(\\pi\\) to our angle, we make use of the fact that the cosine value's sign is flipped when adding \\(\\pi\\) to any angle. Hence, \\(\\cos(\\theta + \\pi) = -\\cos(\\theta)\\).\n\nApplying these properties to our original expression, we get \\(\\cos(n \\times (2\\pi) + \\pi) = -\\cos(0)\\), since adding \\(n \\times (2\\pi)\\) does not change the value due to periodicity, and adding \\(\\pi\\) flips the sign.\n\nSince \\(\\cos(0) = 1\\), we finally have \\(\\cos(n \\times (2\\pi) + \\pi) = -1\\), which is what we set out to prove.\n\nThis proof uses the logical structure of leveraging the cosine function's properties\u2014its periodicity and the effect of adding \\(\\pi\\) to its argument\u2014to establish the given relationship.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In this case, the function `le_of_lt` is applied, which converts the strict inequality `x < b` into a non-strict inequality `x \u2264 b`.

The operation of swapping can be decomposed into two operations that project the pairs to their first and second elements, respectively, and then recombine them in the opposite order.\n\nThe proof proceeds by showing that swapping the supremum of the original set `s` is equivalent to taking the supremum of the set obtained by swapping each pair in `s`. This equivalence is established by two main arguments, corresponding to the two operations involved in swapping (i.e., projection to the first and second elements, and then recombining them in the opposite order):\n- First, it is shown that applying the `Prod.swap` operation after taking the supremum of `s` is equivalent to taking the supremum of the image of `s` under the composition of `Prod.swap` with the projection to the first element (`Prod.fst`).

This is a critical consideration because the measure-theoretic properties of \\( f \\) influence how it interacts with measures.\n\n1. **By_cases**: The proof employs a technique where it considers all possible scenarios with respect to the almost everywhere measurability of \\( f \\) with the zero measure.

The simplification leads to the conclusion that, under both scenarios considered, the measure of the image of a null set (or the zero measure) under the function \\( f \\) is also zero.\n\nThe proof concludes by asserting that no matter the measurability properties of \\( f \\), the mapping of a zero measure through \\( f \\) yields a zero measure in the target space \\( \\beta \\).

The first direction of the proof (\"\u2192\"): If `p = \u22a4`, then by the definition of equality and the properties of the top element (\u22a4) being the universal set in this context, every element `x` of `M` is in `p`. This part uses the assumption that `p` is equal to `\u22a4` to conclude that `p` must contain every element `x` (since `\u22a4` contains every element by definition).\n\n2. The second direction of the proof (\"\u2190\"): If every element `x` is in `p` (i.e., `\u2200 x, x \u2208 p`), then `p` is equal to `\u22a4`. This is shown by taking any element `x` and demonstrating that it must be in `p`, thus covering the whole space `M` and making `p` equivalent to `\u22a4`.\n\nThe proof leverages a functional approach where implications (\u2192 and \u2190) are demonstrated by showing that one condition leads to another. The first part uses the property of `\u22a4` to show that if `p` is equal to `\u22a4`, then it naturally contains every element `x`. The second part establishes the reverse, using the condition that every element is contained in `p` to show that `p` must therefore be `\u22a4`.\n\nThe lemma, along with its proof, essentially establishes a fundamental characteristic of submodules in the realm of algebra, highlighting the condition under which a submodule can be considered equivalent to the entire space.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Let's break down the meaning and the steps involved in a natural language explanation:\n\n1. **Invoking the Axiom or Property of Non-Emptiness for Natural Numbers**: This step is implicit in the `mk_ne_zero _` part of the proof. It refers to an axiom or a previously proven theorem within the Lean4 library that asserts any set that can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (i.e., has the cardinality \u2135\u2080) is not empty. This is because the set of natural numbers itself is not empty, as it contains at least the element 0.\n\n2. **Application to \u2135\u2080**: The specific application of this general principle to \u2135\u2080 (the cardinality of the set of natural numbers) is what constitutes the proof. By the very definition of \u2135\u2080, we are talking about the size of a set that includes all natural numbers. Since we can list natural numbers starting from 0 and going onwards indefinitely, this set cannot be empty.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, by leveraging the axiom or theorem about sets with cardinality \u2135\u2080 not being empty, the conclusion is drawn that \u2135\u2080 itself cannot equal 0. This is a direct application of set theory and the properties of cardinal numbers.\n\nThe proof in Lean4 uses a structured, formal approach to verify this statement, relying on the logical framework and predefined theorems within the Lean4 system. The essence of the proof, when translated into natural language, emphasizes the inherent non-emptiness of the set of natural numbers and, by extension, any set that shares its cardinality, \u2135\u2080.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In simpler terms, it's the \"edge\" of the set.\n\n2. **Set Notation**: The set \\(\\{ z : \u2102 | z.re \u2264 a \\}\\) denotes all complex numbers \\(z\\) whose real part (\\(z.re\\)) is less than or equal to \\(a\\). Similarly, \\(\\{ z | z.re = a \\}\\) denotes all complex numbers whose real part is exactly \\(a\\).\n\n3. **Theorem Statement**: The theorem asserts that the frontier of the set of complex numbers with real parts less than or equal to \\(a\\) is precisely the set of complex numbers whose real parts are exactly \\(a\\).\n\n4. **Proof Strategy**: The proof uses a simplification tactic (`simpa`) combined with a known result about the frontier of half-closed intervals in the real numbers (`frontier_Iic`) and applies it to the preimage under the real part function (`frontier_preimage_re`) of the interval \\([-\\infty, a]\\) (denoted as `Iic a`).\n\n5. **Detailed Steps**:\n   - **Step 1**: Recognize that the problem involves the real part of complex numbers, which can be treated as a function from the complex numbers to the real numbers.\n   - **Step 2**: Apply a known result about the frontier of intervals of real numbers, specifically the interval \\([-\\infty, a]\\), which in mathematical terms is called the lower half-closed interval or `Iic a`.\n   - **Step 3**: The known result (`frontier_Iic`) tells us that the frontier of such an interval in the real numbers is just the point \\(a\\).\n   - **Step 4**: Use the fact that the preimage of a set under a function (in this case, the real part function mapping complex numbers to their real parts) preserves the structure of frontiers. This means that the frontier of the set of complex numbers whose real parts are in \\([-\\infty, a]\\) is the set of complex numbers whose real parts are exactly \\(a\\).\n   - **Step 5**: The `simpa` tactic simplifies the proof by directly applying these observations and known results, concluding that the frontier of the set \\(\\{ z : \u2102 | z.re \u2264 a \\}\\) is indeed \\(\\{ z | z.re = a \\}\\).\n\nIn summary, the proof leverages a combination of a simplification tactic and known results about the behavior of frontiers under preimages and specific properties of intervals in the real numbers to establish the relationship between the set of complex numbers with real parts less than or equal to \\(a\\) and the set of those with real parts exactly equal to \\(a\\).\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The `rfl` tactic asserts that this statement is true by the very definition of equality in this context, closing the proof.\n\nThe proof fundamentally relies on the understanding that a finite set `s` in Lean's framework is equivalent to its internal representation (`s.val`).

A set semiring is a mathematical structure that, among other properties, allows for operations similar to those in algebra but within the context of sets. The \"downward closure\" of a set in this context refers to all elements that are \"less than\" or \"equal to\" elements of the set, according to some ordering defined in the SetSemiring structure.\n\nThe lemma asserts a bidirectional implication (\u2194), meaning that the condition on one side of the statement is true if and only if the condition on the other side is also true.

In simpler terms, it aims to show that the process of combining multiple lists into one, where each list is an element of a bigger list, can be accomplished by a function that is fundamentally simple and computable in a step-by-step manner, without needing any complex operations or infinite loops.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof employs a strategy using the `list_foldr` function with `id` (identity function) and `const []` (a constant function returning an empty list) alongside a combination of `list_append` (function appending one list to another) and `snd` (a function returning the second element of a pair). This setup is used to recursively apply the process of appending lists from the given list of lists to accumulate into a single list.\n\nThe key steps of the proof can be described as follows:\n\n1. **Setup for Recursive Folding:** The operation begins by setting up a recursive fold over the list of lists. This fold uses the identity function and a constant function returning an empty list as initial arguments. It's designed to progressively apply the appending of lists.\n\n2. **Recursive Application:** The proof utilizes a recursive strategy where for each list in the list of lists, it applies the `list_append` function to append it to the accumulating result. This is done through the use of the `to\u2082` and `comp` functions to correctly position and apply the `list_append` function along with `snd` to ensure the operation is applied to the appropriate elements.\n\n3. **Equality and Simplification:** The proof concludes by simplifying the recursive construction using `dsimp` and `induction`, followed by the application of the `simp` tactic to simplify the expressions. This involves an induction on the list of lists, breaking down the proof into a base case (an empty list of lists) and an inductive step (how appending one list affects the result), thereby proving that the original folding operation indeed results in the joining of all lists into one.\n\n4. **Final Equivalence:** The proof wraps up by establishing that the recursive folding operation defined at the start is equivalent to the process of joining lists. This is shown using the `of_eq` function to state that the behavior of the defined folding operation matches the intended behavior of joining a list of lists into a single list.\n\nIn summary, the proof demonstrates, through a combination of recursive folding and simplification techniques, that the operation of joining a list of lists is primitive recursive, adhering to the formalism required in the Lean4 theorem prover environment.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This is achieved through the application of the `SetLike.coe_subset_coe.symm` property, which allows us to move from talking about submonoids as abstract algebraic structures to talking about their underlying sets. Essentially, this step rephrases the problem in terms of set inclusion, making it easier to apply set-theoretic arguments.\n\n2. **Applying Inverse Subset Property**: The core mathematical argument of the proof involves the `Set.inv_subset_inv` property. This property states that for any two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) in a group, if \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\), then the set of inverses of \\(A\\) is a subset of the set of inverses of \\(B\\). In symbols, \\(A \\subseteq B \\implies A^{-1} \\subseteq B^{-1}\\). This is a fundamental result in group theory that leverages the definition of a group inverse and the properties of subsets.\n\nBy applying this property, the proof directly establishes the equivalence stated in the theorem: that \\(S^{-1} \\leq T^{-1}\\) if and only if \\(S \\leq T\\). The forward direction (\\(S \\leq T \\implies S^{-1} \\leq T^{-1}\\)) follows from the direct application of `Set.inv_subset_inv`, while the reverse direction (\\(S^{-1} \\leq T^{-1} \\implies S \\leq T\\)) is implied by the symmetry of the argument (since if the inverses are related in this way, the original sets must be as well).\n\nIn summary, the proof demonstrates the equivalence by translating the problem into set-theoretic terms and then applying a fundamental property of inverses in groups.

Let's break down these concepts and the structure of the proof:\n\n1. **Topological Space Setup**: The proof starts by defining a topological space on the type `\u03b1` with the minimal topology, denoted by `\u22a5` (bottom). This means the topology consists only of the empty set and the whole set `\u03b1`, which is the simplest possible topology on any set.\n\n2. **Main Proof Structure**: The proof constructs an instance of `DenseInducing` for the function `pure`. This is done by showing two main properties:\n    - The induced topology from `\u03b1` to `Ultrafilter \u03b1` via `pure` is equivalent to the topology on `\u03b1`. This is denoted by `\u27e8\u27e8induced_topology_pure.symm\u27e9`.\n    - The range of `pure` is dense in `Ultrafilter \u03b1`, indicated by `denseRange_pure`.

In mathematical terms, this can be interpreted as a condition on the structure `P` that relates the non-emptiness of its parts to a specific property of an element `a`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem follows a series of logical equivalences, starting with the definition of non-emptiness and proceeding through a negation of a negation, finally relating it to the condition that `P.parts` is empty if and only if `a` is the bottom element. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: The theorem begins by considering the equivalence between `P.parts` being non-empty and `a` not being the bottom element (`a \u2260 \u22a5`).\n\n2. **Non-emptiness Defined**: The notion of non-emptiness is first translated into a more formal condition, `nonempty_iff_ne_empty`, which states that a set is non-empty if and only if it is not equal to the empty set. This step rephrases the problem in terms of the emptiness of `P.parts`.\n\n3. **Negation of Negation**: The proof then employs a logical principle, `not_iff_not`, which essentially says that stating something is not the case is equivalent to negating the statement that it is not not the case. This double negation might seem redundant but is a common technique in formal logic to simplify or reframe conditions.\n\n4. **Relation to `P.parts` Being Empty**: Finally, the proof connects the dots by invoking `parts_eq_empty_iff`, a premise or previously proven fact that directly relates the condition of `P.parts` being empty to `a` being the bottom element (`\u22a5`). This step is crucial as it ties the initial statement about non-emptiness to a specific property of `a`.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: By chaining these equivalences, the proof concludes that `P.parts` is non-empty if and only if `a` is not the bottom element, thus establishing the theorem.\n\nIn essence, the proof methodically transforms the initial statement about the non-emptiness of `P.parts` into a statement about `a` not being the bottom element, using definitions and logical equivalences.

Specifically, it asserts that the `TM2.step` function respects the `TM1.step` function under transformation `TrCfg`, meaning that if one configuration transitions to another in the TM2 model, then their transformed counterparts in the TM1 model also exhibit a transition relationship.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof employs several techniques and constructs to establish the relationship between the two models' step functions:\n\n1. **Introduction of Configurations:** The proof starts by considering any two configurations `c\u2081` and `c\u2082` such that `c\u2081` transitions to `c\u2082` under the TM2 model. This transition is encapsulated by the hypothesis `h`.\n\n2. **Case Analysis:** It examines the structure of the Turing machine's current state `l` and performs case analysis on it. For each possible state, it constructs a proof that the stepping functions respect each other.\n\n3. **Existence Claim:** The proof establishes an existence claim (`\u2203 b, _ \u2227 Reaches...`) indicating that for some configurations, there exists a sequence of steps in the TM1 model that corresponds to a transition in the TM2 model. This is a critical step, asserting that for any given transition in TM2, a series of transitions in TM1 can be found that mimics this change.\n\n4. **Induction on the Structure of the Turing Machine:** The proof proceeds by induction on the structure of the Turing machine's instructions (`stmtStRec`). This step is crucial for generalizing the argument to any possible instruction set of the Turing machine. Each type of instruction (here represented as `H\u2081` through `H\u2085`) is examined to show how it respects the stepping function across models.\n\n5. **Detailed Analysis for Each Instruction Type:** For each instruction type, the proof considers how the instruction behaves in the TM2 model and then demonstrates an equivalent sequence of steps in the TM1 model. This part of the proof is dense with technical detail, unfolding definitions (`unfold TM2.stepAux trNormal TM1.stepAux`) and applying simplifications to align the behaviors of the two models.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The proof concludes by showing that for each type of instruction and each possible configuration, there exists a sequence of transitions in the TM1 model that corresponds to a single transition in the TM2 model. This establishes that the `TM2.step` function respects the `TM1.step` function under the transformation `TrCfg`.\n\nIn summary, the proof methodically establishes a correspondence between transitions in the TM2 and TM1 models of Turing machines, asserting that the behavior of the machine under transformation is preserved across models.

This can be interpreted in two main steps based on the theorem's concise proof in Lean4:\n\n1. **Lipschitz Continuity**: The positive part function (\\(posPart\\)) is shown or known to be Lipschitz continuous. In mathematical analysis, a function is Lipschitz continuous if there exists a constant \\(L\\) such that for every pair of points, the function's absolute difference at these points is bounded by \\(L\\) times the distance between the points.

This step is achieved through the `LipschitzWith.continuous_compLp` function or method, which effectively applies the Lipschitz continuity of the \\(posPart\\) function to ensure the continuity of \\(posPart f\\) for any \\(f\\) in \\(L^p(\\mathbb{R}, p, \\mu)\\).\n\nThus, the theorem concludes that the operation of taking the positive part of functions in \\(L^p\\) spaces is a continuous operation, which is an important property in various mathematical and applied contexts, especially where continuity ensures stability and predictability of the operation under small perturbations of the input function \\(f\\).\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The proof strategy is to show the implication is false by proving the left side (the less than comparison) cannot hold. It uses `iff_of_false` to establish the equivalence by proving the nonexistence of any `p` such that `a < p` and `b = p` when `b` is `\u22a5`. The rationale is that there cannot be any element `p` of type `\u03b1` such that `a < p` because `\u22a5` represents a kind of \"infinite\" or \"undefined\" value that cannot be less than any actual element of `\u03b1`.

In simpler terms, it's saying that any computable property you can define on elements of a certain type can be transformed in a way that preserves uniqueness (injectivity) when you're comparing it to the same property. This is a formal way to express that any property or problem is, in a very straightforward sense, equivalent to itself in terms of computational complexity and uniqueness of solutions.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof provided in the Lean4 syntax employs a tuple with four components to demonstrate this self-reducibility:\n\n1. `id`: This signifies that the identity function is being used as the reduction function. In natural language, this means that to show a property is reducible to itself, we simply take each element as it is without any transformation. The identity function, mathematically expressed as \\(f(x) = x\\), doesn't alter the elements in any way.\n   \n2. `Computable.id`: This asserts that the identity function is computable. It's a technical requirement, ensuring that the function used in the reduction (here, the identity function) can be computed by some algorithm. This is obviously true for the identity function since computing \\(f(x) = x\\) is straightforward.\n\n3. `injective_id`: This part of the proof confirms that the identity function is injective, meaning that if \\(f(x) = f(y)\\), then \\(x = y\\). For the identity function, this property is inherently true because it doesn't alter the inputs, ensuring that each input is uniquely mapped to its output.\n\n4. `by simp`: The final component of the proof uses the `simp` tactic, which simplifies the proof goal using predefined simplification rules. In this context, it's used to automatically verify the properties listed above without manually proving them each time. This part of the proof essentially leverages Lean's built-in mechanisms to simplify and finalize the proof, showing that the property \\(p\\) is indeed one-one reducible to itself using the identity function and its properties.\n\nIn summary, the proof demonstrates that any computable property defined on a type that can be encoded is trivially one-one reducible to itself, using the identity function and leveraging its computability and injectivity.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

It asserts that there is no adjacency between any two vertices `v` and `w` in the empty graph, symbolized by `(\u22a5 : SimpleGraph V)`. In other words, for any vertices `v` and `w`, the statement that `v` is adjacent to `w` in the empty graph is equivalent to `False`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is straightforward and relies on the inherent properties of the empty graph within the context of simple graphs. A simple graph, by definition, consists of vertices and edges where each edge connects two distinct vertices and no two edges connect the same pair of vertices. The empty graph, denoted by `(\u22a5 : SimpleGraph V)`, is a special case of a simple graph with no vertices and no edges.\n\n1. **Direct Application of Definitions**: The statement directly applies the definition of the empty graph. In an empty graph, there are no edges by definition. Therefore, the proposition that any two vertices are adjacent (i.e., there exists an edge connecting them) is false. This is because adjacency in a simple graph implies the existence of an edge between two vertices. Since the empty graph has no edges, no two vertices can be adjacent.\n\n2. **Logical Conclusion**: The equivalence to `False` is a logical conclusion derived from the absence of edges in the empty graph. The statement `Adj v w` (which asserts that vertices `v` and `w` are adjacent) cannot hold true in the context of an empty graph. Hence, the claim `(\u22a5 : SimpleGraph V).Adj v w \u2194 False` is justified, as it aligns with the logical structure and content of the definition of adjacency in a simple graph and the nature of the empty graph.\n\n3. **Formal Verification**: In Lean4, `Iff.rfl` essentially states that the proposition on the left side of the `\u2194` (bi-conditional) is identically equal to the proposition on the right side, without the need for further elaboration or proof steps. This is because the statement is self-evident from the definitions involved. In this case, `Iff.rfl` indicates that the equivalence between the non-existence of adjacency in the empty graph and `False` is a reflection of the definition of the empty graph itself.\n\nIn summary, the theorem `bot_adj` leverages the definition of the empty graph and the concept of adjacency in a simple graph to logically deduce that no two vertices can be adjacent in the empty graph, a conclusion that is naturally equivalent to `False`. This proof does not require additional steps beyond understanding the definitions and applying them directly, as captured succinctly by `Iff.rfl` in the Lean4 proof environment.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the proof translated from the Lean4 syntax:\n\n1. **Injection Mapping**: The proof begins by applying an injective (or one-to-one) mapping from integers to rationals, ensuring that distinct elements map to distinct elements, thereby preserving the structure of operations across these sets. This is significant because it allows us to work within the rational numbers (\\(\\mathbb{Q}\\)) without losing information about integer (\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)) relationships.\n\n2. **Simplification**: The statement simplifies the expression of `wittOne p n` through several definitions, including the `wittStructureRat` function, which are part of the Witt vector construction. This step condenses the problem into a more manageable form by removing redundant or irrelevant parts.\n\n3. **Strong Induction**: A strong form of mathematical induction on \\(n\\) is used. Unlike ordinary induction, strong induction allows the proof of an assertion for \\(n\\) to assume the assertion is true for all positive integers less than \\(n\\), not just \\(n-1\\). This approach is crucial for handling the recursive nature of Witt vector definitions.\n\n4. **Case Analysis and Recursion**: The proof proceeds with a detailed analysis of the recursive structure of the Witt vector definition. It specifically looks at how `wittOne p n` behaves under the algebra of the Witt vector operations. Through this, it shows that after applying certain algebraic transformations, the problem reduces to showing certain base cases and recursive steps yield zero.\n\n5. **Handling of Base and Recursive Cases**:\n   - For the base case (when \\(n = 0\\)), the proof directly applies definitions to show that the function evaluates to zero.\n   - For the recursive cases, it uses the induction hypothesis to argue that if the statement holds for all smaller \\(n\\), then it must hold for the current \\(n\\). This involves detailed manipulation of the algebraic structures, showing that each term in the recursive definition contributes nothing to the final sum.\n\n6. **Exclusion of Impossible Cases**: The proof addresses and dismisses impossible scenarios through logical contradictions, further tightening the argument's completeness and correctness.\n\n7. **Conclusion**: Having handled all cases, the proof concludes that indeed, for any positive natural number \\(n\\), `wittOne p n` must evaluate to zero, as initially claimed.\n\nThis proof leverages a combination of injective mapping, simplification, strong induction, and algebraic manipulation within the formal framework provided by Lean4, effectively demonstrating the theorem's validity.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

However, it's important to note that the syntax provided seems to mix elements that might not be directly translatable to Lean4's exact syntax but rather suggests a general form of a mathematical theorem and its proof. With that in mind, I'll proceed with a translation that captures the essence and logical structure of the theorem as it might be expressed in Lean4, along with an explanation in natural language.\n\n# Statement: Prove that the function that takes an element to its inverse is its own left inverse in a group \\(G\\).\n\nThis theorem states that in a group \\(G\\), the function that assigns to each element \\(a\\) its inverse \\(a^{-1}\\) is its own left inverse. This means that applying this function twice to any element of the group will return the original element.\n\n# Proof:\n\nThe proof of this theorem relies on a fundamental property of elements in a group, specifically the property that the inverse of the inverse of an element is the element itself. This property is often stated as \\((a^{-1})^{-1} = a\\).\n\n1. **Given**: A function \\(f: G \\to G\\) defined by \\(f(a) = a^{-1}\\), where \\(a \\in G\\).\n\n2. **To Prove**: The function \\(f\\) is its own left inverse, which means \\(f(f(a)) = a\\) for all \\(a \\in G\\).\n\n3. **Proof**:\n\n   - Consider any element \\(a \\in G\\).\n   - Apply the function \\(f\\) to \\(a\\), which gives \\(f(a) = a^{-1}\\).\n   - Now, apply the function \\(f\\) again, but this time to \\(a^{-1}\\). According to the definition of \\(f\\), this gives \\(f(a^{-1}) = (a^{-1})^{-1}\\).\n   - By the property of inverses in a group, we know that \\((a^{-1})^{-1} = a\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(f(f(a)) = a\\), which shows that \\(f\\) is indeed its own left inverse.\n\nThis proof demonstrates that the operation of taking the inverse in a group is such that if you take the inverse of an element and then take the inverse of that result, you return to the original element. This property is encapsulated in the theorem and is a direct consequence of the definition of a group and the properties of inverses within that structure.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The theorem `joinM_map_joinM` asserts that applying `joinM` to the result of mapping `joinM` over a nested monadic structure is equivalent to just applying `joinM` twice to the nested structure.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof utilizes several fundamental concepts and operations from monadic theory and functional programming, such as `bind`, `map`, and `pure`, along with some specific properties like associativity of `bind` and the interaction between `pure` and `bind`. Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Simplification**: The proof starts by simplifying the left-hand side `joinM (joinM <$> a)` using definitions and known laws.

This could be about simplifying or rearranging the composition of `pure` with another function in the context of binding.\n\n4. **bind_assoc**: This is the associativity law of `bind`, which allows for the regrouping of nested `bind` operations without changing the outcome. This is a key property in monadic operations, allowing for flexibility in the order of operations.\n\n5. **pure_bind**: This step likely involves a law or property about the interaction between `pure` and `bind`, perhaps how a value lifted into the monad (`pure`) and then bound (`bind`) behaves.\n\nThe proof concludes that these simplifications and applications of laws ultimately show that `joinM (joinM <$> a)` is equivalent to `joinM (joinM a)`, maintaining the integrity and logical structure of the original mathematical reasoning.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

It states that if you have a multiset `s` and a function `f` that maps elements from type `\u03b1` to type `\u03b2`, then taking each element of `s`, applying `f` to it, and then creating a new multiset where each element is now the result of applying `f`, is equivalent to directly mapping `f` over the multiset `s`. In other words, individually transforming each element of `s` into a singleton multiset with `f` and then combining these singletons is the same as applying `f` to each element of `s` to get a new multiset.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof is done by induction on the multiset `s`.\n\n1. **Base Case**: We start with the base case where `s` is the empty multiset. In this case, the left-hand side of the theorem, which involves binding over an empty multiset, results in an empty multiset, as does directly mapping `f` over the empty multiset. This proves the base case because both sides of the equation reduce to the empty multiset.\n\n2. **Inductive Step**: Assuming the theorem holds for a multiset `s`, we consider adding one more element `x` to `s` (denoted as `singleton_add` in the proof). The proof then shows that performing the bind operation as described in the theorem statement (which involves applying `f` to `x` and then adding it to the bind operation on `s`) is equivalent to mapping `f` directly over `s` and then adding `f x` to the result. This is shown using the `simp` tactic, which simplifies both sides of the equation, taking into account the inductive hypothesis that the theorem holds for `s`.\n\nIn summary, the proof establishes the theorem by demonstrating that it holds for the empty multiset and that if it holds for any multiset `s`, it also holds when an additional element is added to `s`. This inductive approach confirms that the way of transforming each element of the multiset `s` into a singleton multiset using `f` and then combining is indeed equivalent to applying `f` directly over the entire multiset `s`.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The theorem asserts that when you perform the disjoint sum of multiset `s` with an empty multiset `(0 : Multiset \u03b2)`, the result is equivalent to applying a function `map inl` to the multiset `s`, effectively transforming each element of `s` from type `\u03b1` to type `\u03b1 + \u03b2` (where `inl` is the function that injects elements of `\u03b1` into the sum type `\u03b1 + \u03b2`).\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of the theorem `disjSum_zero` leverages a lemma or a rule from the underlying theory of multisets, identified by the reference `add_zero`. Here's a breakdown of the logical structure and content of the proof in natural language:\n\n1. The operation `disjSum` is defined to combine two multisets in a way that each element of the first multiset is tagged (or injected) with `inl`, indicating that it belongs to the first multiset, and each element of the second multiset is tagged with `inr`, indicating that it belongs to the second multiset. The resulting multiset contains all elements from both multisets with their respective tags.\n\n2. The statement `add_zero _` used in the proof refers to a general principle (or lemma) that adding zero to something leaves it unchanged. In the context of multisets and the `disjSum` operation, this principle implies that performing the disjoint sum of a multiset `s` with an empty multiset `(0 : Multiset \u03b2)` does not alter the elements of `s` but simply tags them with `inl`, as there are no elements in the second multiset to combine with.\n\n3. Therefore, the result of `s.disjSum (0 : Multiset \u03b2)` is equivalent to simply applying the `map inl` operation to `s`, which tags each element of `s` as belonging to the first part of the sum type `\u03b1 + \u03b2` without altering the multiset's structure or the elements' identities. This aligns with the original theorem's statement.\n\nThe proof, thus, concludes by demonstrating that the operation of disjoint summing a multiset with an empty multiset is functionally equivalent to mapping each element of the multiset into the sum type `\u03b1 + \u03b2` using `inl`, underpinned by the `add_zero` principle that adding zero (or an empty multiset, in this context) does not change the value to which it is added.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Specifically, it focuses on the case where this function is applied to a singleton list `[b]` and examines how the outcome depends on the relationship between `a` and `b`, as determined by a relation `R`. The theorem asserts that the result of `destutter' R a` on the list `[b]` will be a two-element list `[a, b]` if `R a b` holds true (meaning the relation `R` between `a` and `b` is satisfied). If `R a b` does not hold, then the result will simply be the single-element list `[a]`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof uses a conditional split (`split_ifs`) based on whether `R a b` is true or false (`with h`). This conditional structure mirrors an \"if-then-else\" logic in many programming languages. Here's a breakdown of the logical steps in more natural language:\n\n1. **Case 1 (`if R a b then [a, b]`):** If the relation `R` between `a` and `b` is true (`h`), then by the definition of `destutter'`, the function should output a list that does not include consecutive duplicates that satisfy the relation `R`. Since `a` and `b` are the only elements and `R a b` is true, the list `[a, b]` is the correct output. This case reflects the logic that, when `a` and `b` are related as per `R`, they both should appear in the result list, maintaining their order.\n\n2. **Case 2 (`else [a]`):** If `R a b` is false, the proof implies that the list resulting from `destutter'` will only contain `[a]`. This follows from the definition of the `destutter'` function, where if the relation `R` between `a` and `b` does not hold, there's no need to insert `b` after `a` to avoid consecutive duplicates, as `b` would not be considered a duplicate in the sense defined by `R`.\n\nThe `simp!

Specifically, it asserts that if a function `f` is integrable over a measure space with respect to a measure `\u03bc`, and another function `g` is almost everywhere equal to `f` with respect to the same measure, then `g` is also integrable over the measure space with respect to `\u03bc`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is constructed using the properties of the integrability of `f` and the almost everywhere equality of `f` and `g`.\n\n1. The theorem starts with the assumption that `f` is integrable over some measure space with respect to a measure `\u03bc`. This integrability is denoted by `Integrable f \u03bc`. Being integrable implies that `f` satisfies certain conditions, specifically, it has a finite integral over the measure space.\n\n2. Next, it is assumed that `f` is almost everywhere equal to another function `g` with respect to the measure `\u03bc`. This is denoted as `f =\u1d50[\u03bc] g`. The notion of almost everywhere equality means that the set of points in the measure space where `f` and `g` differ has measure zero.\n\n3. The goal is to show that `g` is also integrable with respect to `\u03bc`, denoted as `Integrable g \u03bc`. \n\n4. The proof utilizes the properties of the integrability of `f` and the assumption of almost everywhere equality to `g`. It shows that since `f` is integrable and `f =\u1d50[\u03bc] g`, then `g` must also satisfy the conditions for integrability. This is conveyed through the syntax `\u27e8hf.1.congr h, hf.2.congr h\u27e9`, where `hf` represents the hypothesis of `f` being integrable. The `.congr` method is applied to both components of integrability (likely referring to the integrable parts of `f`), with `h` being the hypothesis of almost everywhere equality. This method confirms that the integral properties that hold for `f` due to its integrability and almost everywhere equality also hold for `g`.\n\n5. Therefore, by transferring the properties of integrability from `f` to `g` through the almost everywhere equality, it is concluded that `g` is also integrable with respect to the measure `\u03bc`.\n\nThis proof leverages the concept of almost everywhere equality to extend the property of integrability from one function to another within the same measure space, maintaining the logical structure and mathematical reasoning of the original theorem presented in Lean4's syntax.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The operation in question is subtracting an element represented as `\u22a4` (often used to denote an element at the top of a type, possibly infinity or a maximal element in some contexts) from `a`. The theorem claims that for any `a` in `WithTop \u03b1`, subtracting `\u22a4` from `a` results in `0`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof proceeds by case analysis on `a`, which can take different forms due to its type `WithTop \u03b1`. `WithTop \u03b1` is a type that can either represent a regular element of type `\u03b1` or a special element `\u22a4` representing the top (like infinity). The `cases` tactic in Lean4 splits the proof into cases based on the possible forms of `a`.\n\n1. **Case 1: `a` is a regular element of type `\u03b1`**. In this scenario, subtracting `\u22a4` (the top element or infinity) from any regular element should intuitively result in a form of \"zero\" in the context of `WithTop \u03b1`. This is because subtracting an infinite or maximal value from a finite value leaves you with the minimal or \"zero\" element in this extended type.\n\n2. **Case 2: `a` is `\u22a4` itself**. Subtracting `\u22a4` from `\u22a4` within this type framework can also be interpreted as resulting in \"zero\". This follows from a convention or definition within the `WithTop \u03b1` type's subtraction operation, where the operation involving infinity or a maximal element is designed to yield the minimal or base element of the type, i.e., \"zero\".\n\nIn both cases, the proof concludes with `rfl`, which stands for \"reflexivity\". This means that the equation or statement being proven (in this case, `a - \u22a4 = 0`) is directly evident from the definitions or properties of the operations and types involved without needing further elaboration.

In this statement, `a` and `b` are elements of some sets (possibly different sets, denoted by `\u03b2` and `\u03b1`), and the operation `-\u1d65` represents the subtraction operation between these elements.

The statement `map\u2082_pure` acts as a bridge, showing that operations on the elements can be lifted directly into operations on the filters, preserving the purity of the filters (i.e., their focus on a specific element or outcome).

This is a statement about the stability of non-zero limits under multiplication in the setting of Cauchy sequences.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof is structured as follows:\n\n1. **Assumption Contradiction**: The proof begins by assuming the opposite of what we want to prove, that is, `f * g` converges to zero (denoted as `LimZero (f * g - 0)`), and aims to show a contradiction.\n\n2. **Direct Consequences**:\n   - It establishes that if `f * g` converges to zero, then `f * g` itself must be a zero sequence (`LimZero (f * g)`), simplified by subtraction from zero.\n   - It then shows that neither `f` nor `g` can be a zero sequence (`\u00acLimZero f` and `\u00acLimZero g`), contradicting our initial assumptions (`hf` and `hg`), by leveraging simplification.\n\n3. **Existence of Positive Bounds**:\n   - By arguing against `f` and `g` being zero sequences, it concludes that there must exist positive lower bounds for the absolute values of `f` and `g` over all terms beyond certain indices (`N1` for `f` and `N2` for `g`), respectively.

Therefore, if `f` and `g` are Cauchy sequences that do not converge to zero, their product `f * g` also does not converge to zero.\n\nThis proof leverages the properties of Cauchy sequences, the nature of limits, and basic arithmetic properties to establish the stability of non-zero limits under multiplication in a rigorous mathematical framework.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

It aims to show that for any element `x` in the basis, there exists a corresponding interval `Iio y` that is contained within any neighborhood of `\u22a5`. The steps are as follows:\n\n1. The proof begins by applying a refinement to the neighborhood basis of `\u22a5`, aiming to establish the condition for the intervals `Iio x` for any real number `x`.\n2. For any given `x` such that a neighborhood contains `x`, it seeks to find a rational number `y` that lies between `\u22a5` and `x`. This is based on the property that there exists a rational number between any two real numbers, which is especially relevant here since `\u22a5` represents the infimum of the extended real numbers.\n3. Upon finding such a `y`, the proof establishes an interval `Iio y` which is shown to be a subset of the original interval `Iio x`. This is justified by the fact that `y` is less than `x`, and hence, the interval `Iio y` is necessarily contained within `Iio x`.\n4. The interval `Iio y` is then used to demonstrate the basis property, showing that for any neighborhood of `\u22a5`, there exists an interval of the form `Iio y` that fits within this neighborhood, thereby verifying the original theorem.\n\nIn essence, the proof utilizes the density of rational numbers within the real numbers to refine the basis of neighborhoods around the bottom element of the extended real numbers, showing that these neighborhoods can always be represented by intervals extending to minus infinity and stopping just short of a real number.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The proof for this case uses two key ideas:\n   - First, the operation `product_cons`, which represents the rule for constructing the Cartesian product of a non-empty list (the head of the list followed by the rest of the list, denoted as `_ :: l`) with another list. This operation fundamentally alters the structure of the Cartesian product based on the first element of the list and the Cartesian product of the remainder of the list with the second list.\n   - Second, the recursive application of the theorem `product_nil l`, which applies the current theorem to the tail of the list (`l`). This step assumes that the theorem holds for the smaller list `l` and uses this assumption to conclude the theorem for the original list.\n\nBy simplifying (`simp`) with these two ideas, the proof concludes that for any non-empty list of type `\u03b1`, its Cartesian product with an empty list of type `\u03b2` results in an empty list. This simplification implicitly uses the properties of the Cartesian product and the inductive hypothesis (the theorem's truth for the smaller list `l`) to reach the conclusion.\n\nOverall, the proof leverages pattern matching on the structure of the list, direct application of definitions, and inductive reasoning to prove the theorem for all lists of type `\u03b1`.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Being injective means that if the cast of two elements from `R` into `\u210d[R,c\u2081,c\u2082]` results in the same quaternion, then those two elements from `R` must be identical.\n\n# Proof:\nTo prove this theorem, we assume we have two elements from `R` (let's call them `x` and `y`) such that when we cast both `x` and `y` to `\u210d[R,c\u2081,c\u2082]`, they result in the same quaternion.

This assumption can be formally written as `coe(x) = coe(y)`.\n\n2. The strategy is to show that `x = y` by using the property of quaternions. Specifically, we focus on the real part (`re`) of the quaternion. The reason for this focus is that the casting function `coe` from `R` to `\u210d[R,c\u2081,c\u2082]` is defined in such a way that the real part of the resulting quaternion directly corresponds to the original element from `R`.\n\n3. By applying `congr_arg` to the equality `coe(x) = coe(y)` with the function `re`, we obtain `re(coe(x)) = re(coe(y))`. This step is critical because it leverages the fact that if two quaternions are equal, then their corresponding components (in this case, the real parts) are also equal.\n\n4. Given that `re(coe(x))` and `re(coe(y))` are just `x` and `y` respectively (because the real part of the quaternion produced by `coe` reflects the original real number), we conclude that `x = y`.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that the function `coe` is injective, meaning it preserves distinctness: if `coe(x) = coe(y)`, then `x = y`.\n\nThis conclusion relies on the fundamental properties of quaternions and the specific way in which real numbers are cast to quaternions in the algebra `\u210d[R,c\u2081,c\u2082]`.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Thus, if one set is included in another when their bounds increase, the function creating these sets is monotone.\n\n5. **Combining Monotonicities:** By composing the monotonicity of `f` with the monotonicity of `Iio`, we conclude that the new function (mapping `x` to `Iio (f x)`) is also monotone. This is because, if `x <= y`, then `f(x) <= f(y)` due to the monotonicity of `f`, and consequently, the set of values less than `f(x)` is included in or equal to the set of values less than `f(y)` due to the monotonicity of `Iio`. Therefore, as `x` increases, the set `Iio (f x)` either stays the same or grows, maintaining the monotonicity.\n\n6. **Conclusion:** The lemma demonstrates a fundamental property of monotone functions and their composition with operations that preserve order, like `Iio`. It shows that under the condition of monotonicity for a function `f`, the operation of creating intervals of numbers less than the outputs of `f` across its domain also respects monotonicity. This is a reflection of how order-preserving transformations maintain order when applied in sequence, a principle with wide applications in mathematical analysis and theoretical computer science.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This can be encapsulated in the statement: \"For all `x` and for all `y` greater than 0, `x < log(y)` if and only if `exp(x) < y`.\"\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem utilizes a fundamental property of logarithmic and exponential functions, which are inverse functions of each other.

The proof begins by invoking a rewrite tactic (`rw`), which is a command in Lean4 to replace one side of the equation with another based on known identities or theorems.\n\n2. The specific rewrite rule used is `\u2190 exp_lt_exp`, which applies the fact that for any two real numbers `a` and `b`, `a < b` if and only if `exp(a) < exp(b)`. This is a fundamental property of the exponential function, reflecting its strictly increasing nature.\n\n3. Next, it applies `exp_log hy`, where `hy` is the hypothesis that `y > 0`. This part of the proof uses the fact that the exponential of the logarithm of `y` (where `y` is positive) is equal to `y` itself. This is another fundamental property that holds because the exponential and logarithmic functions are inverses of each other.\n\n4. By combining these steps, the proof effectively shows that comparing `x` with `log(y)` is equivalent to comparing `exp(x)` with `exp(log(y))`, which simplifies to `exp(x)` with `y`, given the condition that `y` is greater than zero.\n\nThe logical structure and content of this proof are built upon the intrinsic properties of logarithmic and exponential functions, specifically their inverse relationship and the strictly increasing nature of the exponential function.

It starts by assuming the opposite of what we're trying to prove, specifically that `a` is not negative, which means `a` is either positive or zero (`a \u2265 0`). Under this assumption, if `b` is non-negative (`0 \u2264 b`), the product of `a` and `b` should also be non-negative because the multiplication of two non-negative numbers cannot result in a negative number.

Assume `a * b < 0` (the product of `a` and `b` is negative) and `0 \u2264 b` (b is non-negative).\n2. Assume for contradiction that `a` is not negative (`a \u2265 0`).\n3.

This theorem is about understanding how negation interacts with the linear transformation when applied to elements of a submodule.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof proceeds by showing that for any element in the submodule `p`, its image under the negated transformation `-f` is the same as the image under `f` followed by negation.

The proof constructs an element `x` such that `-x` is in `p` (thanks to the submodule's closure under negation), and shows that mapping `x` with `f` and then negating it is the same as mapping `-x` with `-f`. This demonstrates that any element's image under the negated transformation can be achieved by taking the negation after applying the original transformation.\n\n2. **Second part:** Conversely, it considers any element that, when mapped by `f` and then negated, is in the mapped submodule. Similar to the first part, it finds an element `x` such that `-x` belongs to `p`, showing that the process of mapping with `-f` and then taking the negation (in reverse order) results in the same element as directly applying `-f` to `-x`. This step confirms that any element achieved by applying `f` and then negating can also be obtained directly by applying `-f`.\n\nThe essence of the proof lies in the symmetry and linearity of the transformations involved, alongside the properties of the submodule `p` (specifically, its closure under negation).

This step replaces the target expression with an equivalent one based on this lemma, making explicit the formula for calculating the interval's cardinality.\n   - `Fintype.card_ofFinset`: This part suggests that the calculation of the cardinality is being related to the notion of a finite set (`Finset`) in Lean4. Specifically, it's indicating that the cardinality of the interval can be determined by viewing the interval as a finite set and then calculating the cardinality of that set.\n\nThe rewrite tactic (`rw`) is a powerful tool in theorem proving that allows one to replace parts of the goal using equivalences or definitions.

This formula reflects a basic principle in combinatorics and discrete mathematics, capturing the intuition that the number of integers in a closed interval from `a` to `b` is the length of the interval plus one (to include both endpoints), converted into a natural number to fit within the type constraints of Lean4's mathematical framework.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Essentially, this step breaks down how `indexOf` operates on our specific list `a :: l`.\n\n2. **Applying `beq_self_eq_true`**: Next, the proof uses the property `beq_self_eq_true`.

Specifically, it focuses on an arbitrary element `a` from the set `s`, where `s` satisfies some condition `hs`.\n\n2. **Rewrite using `sum_apply'`:** The next step involves rewriting the expression using `sum_apply'`, a specific function in Lean that applies the summing function to the element `a` and the condition `hs`. This step adjusts our focus from the abstract sum to its application on a specific element.\n\n3. **Simplification:** The proof then simplifies the expression using several simplification rules (`simp only`). This includes recognizing that the application of the zero function (`zero_apply`), the measure of zero (`Measure.coe_zero`), and the general principle of applying zero in a function (`Pi.zero_apply`) all inherently equal zero. It also explicitly states that the total sum (`tsum`) of zeros is zero (`tsum_zero`).\n\nBy sequentially applying these logical steps, the proof demonstrates that under the given conditions, the sum of the function that always returns zero across a countable index set indeed equals zero.

It asserts that if you swap the components of the pairs in the product space (a process mathematically represented by `Prod.swap`), the resulting measure is the same as if you had started with \u03bd as the first measure and \u03bc as the second. In simpler terms, the theorem states that swapping the order of the measures in the product does not change the measure of the set.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof begins by establishing a key intermediate result, which is that the measure obtained by applying `Prod.swap` to the product of the finite sequences (`sFiniteSeq`) of \u03bc and \u03bd, indexed over \u2115 \u00d7 \u2115 (the set of pairs of natural numbers), is equal to the measure obtained if we swapped the indices of \u03bc and \u03bd in those finite sequences before taking their product. This is shown by the equation:\n\\[ \\text{sum} (\\lambda i \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\mapsto \\text{map} \\, \\text{Prod.swap} \\, ((\\text{sFiniteSeq} \\, \\mu \\, i.1) \\, \\text{prod} \\, (\\text{sFiniteSeq} \\, \\nu \\, i.2))) = \\text{sum} (\\lambda i \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} \\mapsto \\text{map} \\, \\text{Prod.swap} \\, ((\\text{sFiniteSeq} \\, \\mu \\, i.2) \\, \\text{prod} \\, (\\text{sFiniteSeq} \\, \\nu \\, i.1))) \\]\n\nTo prove this, the proof uses extensionality (represented by `ext s hs`) to focus on the equality of measures over all subsets `s` that are measurable (`hs`). It uses the property that summing over all elements of a function (in this case, the measure after applying `Prod.swap`) is equal for both sequences. This relies on the commutativity property of the product measure (`Equiv.prodComm \u2115 \u2115`). Essentially, it leverages the fact that swapping the order of products in \u2115 \u00d7 \u2115 does not affect the sum of the measures over all possible index pairs.\n\nAfter establishing this intermediate result, the proof proceeds to the main conclusion by using properties of `sum_sFiniteSeq`, `prod_sum`, and `map_sum`. The `map_sum` operation involves applying `Prod.swap` across the sum of measures, and it's shown to preserve the measure due to the previously established equality. The proof concludes by demonstrating that swapping the roles of \u03bc and \u03bd in their product does not alter the measure of any given subset, thus proving the theorem. \n\nThe technical maneuvers involve:\n- Using `rw` to rewrite expressions based on established rules and properties.\n- Employing `exact` to assert that a given expression directly proves the required result.\n- Utilizing `congr` and `ext1` for congruence and extensionality, respectively, to handle the function and measure equality.\n- Applying `refine'` in combination with `prod_eq` to finalize the argument about product measure equality under swapping.\n\nThroughout, the proof meticulously maintains the integrity of mathematical reasoning within the framework of measure theory, ensuring the logic flows coherently from the premises to the conclusion.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In essence, it provides a general framework to understand when an inequality involving a real number and an integer holds in relation to the floor function.\n\n2. **Modulo Casting (`mod_cast`):** The `mod_cast` function is used to bridge type discrepancies between the real number domain and the integer domain within the Lean4 theorem prover.

This step is crucial for maintaining the rigor of type systems in formal proof environments.\n\n3. **Applying the Lemma to Our Specific Case:** By invoking `le_floor_iff'` with our specific case of comparing \\(x\\) and \\(1\\), we leverage the lemma's general statement to assert the equivalence between \"1 is less than or equal to the floor of \\(x\\)\" and \"1 is less than or equal to \\(x\\)\" directly.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** The application of the lemma, facilitated by type casting, directly leads to the conclusion that the statement \"1 \u2264 \\(\\lfloor x \\rfloor_+\\)\" is logically equivalent to \"1 \u2264 \\(x\\)\", thereby proving the theorem.\n\nIn summary, the theorem asserts that for any real number \\(x\\), the mathematical statement that \"1 is less than or equal to the floor of \\(x\\)\" is equivalent to saying \"1 is less than or equal to \\(x\\)\" itself.

The frontier of a set \\(s\\) refers to the points that are on the boundary of \\(s\\), meaning points that are neither in the interior nor completely outside \\(s\\), but where every neighborhood of these points contains both points in \\(s\\) and not in \\(s\\).\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof employs several foundational concepts and theorems from topology and set theory, articulated within the framework of the Lean4 theorem prover. Here's a breakdown in natural language:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: The goal is to prove that the frontier of \\(s\\) is disjoint from \\(t\\), given that \\(t\\) is an open set and \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) are disjoint. In the language of set theory, two sets are disjoint if their intersection is empty.\n\n2. **Use of `subset_compl_iff_disjoint_right`:** This part of the proof leverages a theorem which states that one set is a subset of the complement of another set if and only if the two sets are disjoint. This theorem is applied to infer that the frontier of \\(s\\) is disjoint from \\(t\\) by showing it's a subset of \\(t\\)'s complement.\n\n3. **`frontier_subset_closure`:** The proof then invokes the property that the frontier of a set \\(s\\) is always a subset of the closure of \\(s\\). The closure of \\(s\\) includes \\(s\\) itself and all its limit points (points not in \\(s\\) but every neighborhood of which contains points of \\(s\\)).\n\n4. **`closure_minimal`:** Following this, the proof uses the minimality property of closure. Specifically, if a set is disjoint from another, its closure remains the minimal closed set containing it that maintains the disjointness. This is applied by showing that, because \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) are disjoint, the closure of \\(s\\) does not intersect with \\(t\\).\n\n5. **`disjoint_left.1 hd`:** This extracts the assumption that \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) are disjoint to apply it in the reasoning about the closure of \\(s\\).\n\n6. **`isClosed_compl_iff.2 ht`:** Finally, the proof uses the fact that the complement of an open set is closed. Since \\(t\\) is given as open, its complement is closed.\n\nBy chaining these logical steps, the proof establishes that the frontier of \\(s\\) is a subset of the complement of \\(t\\), which, due to the initial assumption of disjointness between \\(s\\) and \\(t\\), leads to the conclusion that the frontier of \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) are disjoint. This maintains the logical structure and content of the original theorem and proof in Lean4 syntax, translating complex formal logic into accessible natural language while preserving the mathematical reasoning.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",
