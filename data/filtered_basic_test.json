The theorem starts by taking two sets `A` and `B`, assuming that `A` is a subset of `B` (indicated by `h`).\n2.

This method is a way of generating a \u03c3-algebra (a collection of sets) that is smaller or equal to another \u03c3-algebra.\n3.

Specifically, the theorem states that the product \u03c3-algebra is generated by taking the Cartesian product of sets `s` and `t` that are measurable within their respective spaces. This generated \u03c3-algebra is equivalent to the product measure space created by these two measurable spaces.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof utilizes several foundational concepts from measure theory, particularly related to \u03c3-algebras and measurable sets, to establish the equivalence between two mathematical objects:\n\n1. **Generating the product \u03c3-algebra**: It begins by defining the generation of a \u03c3-algebra from the Cartesian product of measurable sets from two spaces. This is done using the `generateFrom` function applied to `image2 (\u00b7 \u00d7\u02e2 \u00b7) { s : Set \u03b1 | MeasurableSet s } { t : Set \u03b2 | MeasurableSet t }`.

This equivalence is established through the application of `generateFrom_eq_prod`, along with arguments concerning the measurability of sets within their spaces (`generateFrom_measurableSet`) and the property of being countably spanning (`isCountablySpanning_measurableSet` for both spaces involved).\n\nIn essence, the proof demonstrates that by starting with the Cartesian product of measurable sets from two spaces and generating a \u03c3-algebra from these products, one ends up with the same structure as if one directly constructed the product measure space from these two measurable spaces.

This is reasoned through the principle that the measure (volume in this context) of a subset is always less than or equal to the measure of the set it is a part of. Here, the closed interval from 0 to \\(r\\) is a subset of all real numbers.\n\n4. **Conclusion for Infiniteness:** Finally, by showing that for any non-negative real number \\(r\\), the measure or volume of the set of all real numbers is greater than or equal to \\(r\\), it concludes that the volume of the set of all real numbers must be infinite. This uses a fundamental property of extended real numbers, where if something is greater than or equal to every member of a set of numbers (in this case, all non-negative real numbers), then it must be the top element of that set, which is infinity (\u221e) in this context.\n\nIn essence, the proof demonstrates through a series of logical steps, grounded in the properties of measure and set theory, that the volume of the entire set of real numbers cannot be bounded by any finite number and thus must be infinite.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This relates to how we can construct the Borel \u03c3-algebra from simpler sets, specifically using the concept of generating a \u03c3-algebra from a collection of sets, here being the lower half-open intervals.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof is structured as follows:\n\n1. **Refinement via `le_antisymm`**:\n   The proof begins with applying the `le_antisymm` lemma, which asserts that two \u03c3-algebras are equal if each is a subset (or sub-\u03c3-algebra) of the other. This is established by demonstrating both `borel \u03b1 \u2264 .generateFrom (range Iio)` and its converse.\n\n2. **Rewriting using `borel_eq_generateFrom_of_subbasis`**:\n   The proof uses the lemma `borel_eq_generateFrom_of_subbasis`, which relates the Borel \u03c3-algebra to a \u03c3-algebra generated by a subbasis.

This is crucial because the \u03c3-algebra generated by these intervals must contain all such intervals as measurable sets.\n\n4. **Case analysis and dealing with complements**:\n   The proof proceeds by case analysis, considering whether `a` has an element `b` such that `a` is less than `b`, and dealing with the complement of `(Iio a)` sets. This involves handling cases where `a` can be covered by countably many intervals, using properties of open intervals and complements to show that these sets and their complements are in the generated \u03c3-algebra.\n\n5. **Completing the proof of inclusion**:\n   This part of the proof demonstrates that any set in the Borel \u03c3-algebra can be constructed from the generated \u03c3-algebra, effectively showing the required inclusion.\n\n6. **Demonstrating the converse inclusion**:\n   Finally, the proof shows the converse, that any set in the \u03c3-algebra generated by `(Iio a)` for all `a` is also a Borel set.

In this context, the sets in question are subsets of the product space formed by combining two measurable spaces, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), where each set within these spaces is measurable.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof leverages a foundational property of measurable sets: the collection of measurable sets within a given measurable space forms a \u03c0-system. Specifically, the proof invokes the theorem `isPiSystem_measurableSet.prod`, which states that the product of two \u03c0-systems that each consist of measurable sets from their respective spaces also forms a \u03c0-system in the product space of these two spaces.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the logical structure of the proof:\n\n1. **Premise**: The theorem starts with the premise that individual sets `s` and `t`, which come from spaces `\\(\\alpha\\)` and `\\(\\beta\\)`, respectively, are measurable.

It asserts that the volume measure in a real inner product space (which can be thought of as the \"usual\" way of measuring lengths, areas, volumes, etc.) is exactly the same as the Stieltjes measure derived from the identity function (a function that essentially \"maps\" each real number to itself). This equivalence highlights a fundamental property of measure theory in the context of real analysis, bridging the concept of volume with a specific instance of Stieltjes measures.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof is structured into several key steps, employing Lean4's syntax and theorem-proving capabilities. Here's a breakdown of the logical flow and content of the proof, translated into natural language:\n\n1. **Additive Left Invariance of Stieltjes Measure:** The first step establishes that the Stieltjes measure, generated by the identity function, is additively left-invariant. This means that shifting any measurable set by a constant amount does not change its measure. This property is proven by considering the measure of open intervals (`Ioo`, which stands for open intervals in real numbers) and using a rational approximation argument. The crucial point here is showing that for any shift `a`, the measure of the shifted interval equals the measure of the original interval, which is achieved through specific manipulations involving the identity function and the properties of the Stieltjes measure.\n\n2. **Volume of the Parallelepiped Spanned by the Standard Orthonormal Basis:** The next part proves that the volume (under the Stieltjes measure) of a specific parallelepiped defined by the standard orthonormal basis in the real numbers (`\u211d`) is `1`. This is shown by directly calculating the Stieltjes measure of the parallelepiped, relying on the properties of the orthonormal basis and the definition of the Stieltjes measure. The argument hinges on recognizing that, due to the nature of the standard orthonormal basis and the identity function, this volume calculation simplifies to a straightforward evaluation.\n\n3. **Equivalence of Volume and Stieltjes Measure:** The final step involves rewriting the right-hand side of the theorem statement to align with the earlier established properties, particularly focusing on the unique characterization of the addHaar measure (which represents a generalized notion of volume in measure theory) of the mentioned parallelepiped. By linking this characterization with the previously established volume of `1` for the parallelepiped, the proof concludes that the volume measure indeed coincides with the Stieltjes measure generated by the identity function on the real line.\n\nThe logical structure of the proof meticulously builds from the properties of the Stieltjes measure and specific geometric considerations in \u211d, leading to the elegant conclusion that for the real line, traditional volume and the Stieltjes measure from the identity function are one and the same.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The proof starts by invoking the general adjunction relationship between `map` and `comap` in the context of measurable spaces, which is represented by `gc_comap_map f`.

This is asserting that applying the `comap` function with `id` to a measurable space does not alter it.\n\n2. **Method (`MeasurableSpace.ext`)**: The proof begins by invoking `MeasurableSpace.ext`, a method to prove that two measurable spaces are equal. This is done by showing that for every set `s`, `s` is measurable in `m.comap id` if and only if `s` is measurable in `m`. The method `MeasurableSpace.ext` thus requires us to prove this bi-directional condition for any set `s`.\n\n3. **First Direction (`\u27e8fun \u27e8_, hs', h\u27e9 => h \u25b8 hs', ...`)**: For any set `s` that is measurable in `m.comap id`, it must be the case that it was already measurable in `m`.

The proof for this direction uses the fact that applying `id` does not change the set, thus if `s` was measurable in `m.comap id`, it was because `s` was measurable in `m` to begin with.\n\n4. **Second Direction (`fun h => \u27e8s, h, rfl\u27e9`)**: Conversely, for any set `s` that is measurable in `m`, it can be shown to be measurable in `m.comap id` by directly applying the definition of `comap` with the identity function. The `\u27e8s, h, rfl\u27e9` construct is used to explicitly construct the evidence required to prove `s` is measurable in `m.comap id`, with `h` being the proof that `s` is measurable in `m`, and `rfl` confirming that applying the identity function does not change the set.\n\nIn essence, the lemma and its proof establish that the operation of `comap` with the identity function over any measurable space `m` results in no change to the space.

In more formal terms, it states that for any two structures `m\u2081` and `m\u2082`, and a function `f`, the operation of mapping `f` over the intersection of `m\u2081` and `m\u2082` yields the same result as the intersection of `m\u2081` mapped by `f` and `m\u2082` mapped by `f`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem utilizes the `gc_comap_map` property. This property is a general condition that relates the operations of `map` and `comap` (the reverse of map, in a sense) under certain conditions that make them \"compatible\" in a generalized context. Specifically, the `u_inf` part refers to a universal property related to the intersection (`\u2293`) operation within this context. \n\n1. **Starting Point**: We begin with the left-hand side of the equation, `(m\u2081 \u2293 m\u2082).map f`, which represents the operation of first taking the intersection of `m\u2081` and `m\u2082`, and then applying the mapping function `f` to this intersection.\n\n2. **Application of `gc_comap_map`**: The `gc_comap_map f` property is then applied. This property essentially states that there's a kind of symmetry or duality between the `map` and `comap` operations under `f`, especially when considering operations like intersections. It provides the foundation to transition from operations on the original structures to operations on their images under `f`.\n\n3. **Final Step**: Utilizing the `gc_comap_map` property transitions our expression to the right-hand side, `m\u2081.map f \u2293 m\u2082.map f`. This means that instead of first taking the intersection and then mapping, we can map each structure individually with `f` and then take the intersection of these mapped structures to obtain the equivalent result.\n\nIn simpler terms, the proof shows that when it comes to applying a function to the intersection of two structures, you can either apply the function after taking the intersection, or take the intersection after applying the function to each structure individually.

The context here is within a space of functions from some domain `\u03b1` to a field `F`, with a measure `\u03bc` and a real number `p` that specifies the norm. In simpler terms, it's about measuring the \"size\" or \"length\" of the zero function in a specific mathematical sense, and this theorem claims that measure is zero.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof proceeds by considering different cases based on the value of `p`, which influences how the seminorm is calculated.\n\n1. **Case when `p = 0`:** The proof first checks if `p` is equal to zero. If `p` is indeed zero, the seminorm is directly simplified to be zero using the definitions related to this specific case.\n\n2. **Case when `p = \u221e` (infinity):** Next, the proof checks if `p` is infinity. If so, it simplifies the expression for seminorm to zero, but this time the simplification is based on the definitions that apply when `p` is infinity, specifically using `snorm_exponent_top` and `snormEssSup_zero`.\n\n3. **For other values of `p`:** If `p` is neither zero nor infinity, the proof uses a more general form of the seminorm (indicated by `snorm_eq_snorm'`). This requires showing that `p` is strictly neither zero nor infinity, which is done by rewriting `p \u2260 0` and ensuring that the conditions are met for this more general calculation. In this case, it argues based on properties (`ENNReal.toReal_pos`) that ensure the calculation can proceed correctly and concludes that the seminorm is zero.\n\nThroughout these steps, the proof makes use of conditional reasoning (checking cases for `p`) and simplification based on known properties and definitions (like `snorm_exponent_top`, `snormEssSup_zero`, and `ENNReal.toReal_pos`). The result aligns across all scenarios: the seminorm of the zero function, regardless of the value of `p`, is zero, which intuitively makes sense since the zero function does not \"stretch\" or \"occupy\" any \"space\" in the mathematical sense being measured.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Here, `\u03b1 \u2192 E` denotes a function from a set `\u03b1` to a set `E`, where `\u03b1` can be thought of as the domain (often a subset of the real numbers) and `E` as the codomain (also often a subset of the real numbers or the real numbers themselves). The theorem asserts that a specific function, the zero function (which returns zero for any input), belongs to the space \u2112p under any measure \u03bc. The measure \u03bc is a way to assign a \"size\" or \"volume\" to subsets of the domain \u03b1, and p is a parameter that specifies which Lp space we are considering.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof provided in Lean4 syntax proceeds as follows:\n\n1. It begins by asserting that the zero function is strongly measurable. In the context of the Lean4 theorem prover, `aestronglyMeasurable_zero` is a predefined result or assumption stating that the zero function is indeed strongly measurable. Strong measurability is a technical condition necessary for functions to be considered within Lp spaces and involves the function's behavior with respect to the measure space.\n\n2. The proof then uses the `rw [snorm_zero]` command, which stands for \"rewrite using `snorm_zero`.\" This is applying a lemma or theorem named `snorm_zero`, which likely states that the p-norm (or snorm) of the zero function is zero. The p-norm or snorm is a measure of a function's magnitude in Lp spaces, calculated as the p-th root of the integral of the function's absolute value raised to the power of p.\n\n3. Finally, it concludes with `exact ENNReal.coe_lt_top`, asserting that the computed snorm of the zero function (which is 0) is indeed less than infinity (`top`). This is important because, for a function to belong to an Lp space, its p-norm must be a real, finite number. The notation `ENNReal.coe_lt_top` suggests the use of extended non-negative reals (`ENNReal`), within which `top` represents infinity, and `coe` is likely a coercion function that interprets the snorm (a real number) within the extended real numbers.\n\nIn simpler terms, the proof verifies that the zero function is in the Lp space by showing it meets the necessary conditions: it is strongly measurable, and its p-norm is a finite number (specifically, zero), thereby satisfying the criteria for membership in the Lp space.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The goal is to show that this \u03c3-algebra is equal to the top element (\u22a4), which in this context means showing that every subset of the space is in the \u03c3-algebra.\n\n2. **Application of `eq_top_iff.2`:** This step uses the implication that for the \u03c3-algebra to be considered equal to the top element, it must be that for any set `x`, the condition for `x` being in the \u03c3-algebra is satisfied. This is approached by showing that the measure of any set `x` satisfies the Carath\u00e9odory condition, which is essentially a technical condition involving measures of subsets.\n\n3. **Using `le_sInf` and `le_trans`:** These constructs are used to show that the measure of any set `x` satisfies the necessary condition by a series of inequalities. The `le_sInf` part involves showing that the measure of `x` is less than or equal to any bound that applies to all sets satisfying a certain property, while `le_trans` is used for transitive application of these inequalities.\n\n4. **Existence of a Set `y`:** It introduces a specific set `y` that satisfies the properties needed for the argument.

This involves understanding that `toOuterMeasure`'s behavior on a set `s` can be decomposed into more fundamental operations, specifically an infinite sum (tsum) over elements of the set, as indicated by `ENNReal.tsum_eq_zero`. This step essentially breaks down the problem into more manageable parts by relating the outer measure's application to zero with the conditions under which an infinite sum equals zero.\n\n2. **Application of `Function.funext_iff.symm.trans Set.indicator_eq_zero'`**: The next step employs a transformation using the symmetry of the function extensionality (`funext`) theorem (`Function.funext_iff.symm`) combined with a transition to a property about set indicators (`Set.indicator_eq_zero'`). This crucial step bridges the gap between the infinite sum condition and the disjointness of sets by showing that for the measure of a set `s` to be zero, it is necessary and sufficient that the set `s` does not intersect with the `support` of the probability measure `p`. The indicator function, which takes the value 1 on the support of `p` and 0 outside, plays a key role here. The condition that the sum (or, by extension, the outer measure) is zero translates to the indicator function being zero on `s`, which implies that `s` does not intersect with the support of `p`.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: By logically connecting these steps, the proof concludes that the condition for `p.toOuterMeasure s = 0` is indeed equivalent to the `support` of `p` and the set `s` being disjoint. This conclusion is not just a mathematical formality but reflects a deeper property about measures and sets: a measure assigns a size or volume to sets, and if a set is outside the region where the measure is \"focused\" (its support), then that set is considered to have size zero by that measure.\n\nThis proof combines fundamental concepts in measure theory with specific properties of the `toOuterMeasure` function and the notion of support for a measure, illustrating the deep interconnectedness of these concepts.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In this context, it's applied to prove that the set representation (`Set`) of the module's range under the identity map corresponds precisely to the module's entire space.\n\n2. **Application of `Set.range_id`**: This part of the proof leverages the fact that the range of the identity function over a set includes all elements of the set itself. It's a fundamental property of identity functions that by mapping each element to itself, the output set (range) naturally encompasses every element of the input set.\n\nCombining these two steps, the proof concludes that the range of the identity linear map over module \\(M\\) is indeed equal to the entire module (\\(\\top\\)), as every element maps to itself, covering the whole space without omission. This aligns perfectly with the intuitive understanding of an identity map's role in a mathematical structure, thereby confirming the theorem's claim.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The identity linear map is a function that takes any vector in \\(V\\) and returns it unchanged.\n   - `(LinearEquiv.refl K V).injective`: This denotes the injective function obtained from the linear equivalence that is the reflexivity of \\(V\\) over itself, meaning it is an isomorphism from \\(V\\) to \\(V\\) that is naturally injective.

It simplifies both conditions to their core components, focusing on the requirements for differentiability without the constraints of a specific set for the former.\n\n2. **Utilizing Universal Set and Preimage Concepts**: The `preimage_univ` and `differentiableWithinAt_univ` are terms that relate to the function being considered over the universal set, or in other words, everywhere. This simplification step emphasizes that when assessing differentiability within the context of the universal set, one essentially considers the function in its entirety without restricting to a subset of its domain.\n\n3. **Equivalence Demonstration**: The core of the proof is showing that, through simplification and understanding of differentiability, the conditions for a function being line differentiable within any set at a point in a specific direction, and being line differentiable at that point in that direction, are equivalent. This is because the universal set encompasses all possible sets, and therefore, any condition that holds universally must also hold specifically, and vice versa.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Through logical simplification and understanding of the underlying definitions, the proof concludes that the condition of line differentiability of a function at a point (and in a certain direction) does not change whether we consider the function over its entire domain or without specifying the domain.

The goal is to show that if `x < y`, then `log(y) < log(x)`, adhering to the definition of a strictly decreasing function.\n\n2. **Logarithm Transformation**: The proof continues by transforming `log(x)` and `log(y)` into `log(abs(x))` and `log(abs(y))` respectively. This step is justified since, for negative numbers, the logarithm function is conventionally defined in terms of their absolute values, turning the argument positive, which is a requirement for the logarithm function to be well-defined.\n\n3. **Application of `log_lt_log`**: The next step is to apply the `log_lt_log` lemma. This lemma states that for any two positive real numbers `a` and `b`, if `a < b`, then `log(a) < log(b)`. To use this lemma, two conditions must be satisfied:\n   - The argument of the first log (corresponding to `y` in this case) must be positive, which is ensured by `abs_pos.2 hy.ne`, indicating that the absolute value of `y` (a negative number) is positive.\n   - `a < b` must hold after the transformation to absolute values. This is where the original condition that `x < y` (under the assumption that both are negative) translates to `abs(y) < abs(x)` due to the properties of absolute values and negation.\n\n4. **Final Argument Construction**: The proof concludes by explicitly stating that the absolute values of `x` and `y`, when `x` and `y` are negative, are simply their negations (this is what `abs_of_neg` achieves).

Let's break down the Lean4 syntax into its logical components to understand the proof:\n\n1. `Complex.continuous_ofReal` indicates that the function which converts a real number to a complex number (by taking a real number \\(x\\) and mapping it to \\(x + 0i\\)) is continuous. This is a foundational property, given that the transition from real numbers to their complex equivalent (with an imaginary part of 0) does not involve any \"jumps.\"\n\n2. `Complex.continuous_cos` asserts that the cosine function, when considered as a function from the complex numbers to the complex numbers, is continuous. This is a more general statement than required for real numbers, since the complex cosine function can handle inputs with non-zero imaginary parts as well.\n\n3. `Complex.continuous_re` states that taking the real part of a complex number (i.e., going from \\(x + yi\\) to \\(x\\)) is a continuous function. This operation does not introduce any discontinuity as it simply ignores the imaginary part.\n\n4. The `.comp` syntax stands for function composition. So, `Complex.continuous_cos.comp Complex.continuous_ofReal` combines the first two steps into a single operation that first converts a real number to a complex number and then applies the cosine function. This composition is itself continuous because both component functions are continuous.\n\n5. Finally, `Complex.continuous_re.comp ...` wraps the above composition with the operation of taking the real part. Since the cosine of a real number is always a real number, this last step effectively confirms that when you start with a real number, apply the complex cosine, and then take the real part, you end up with the same result as applying the real cosine directly. The continuity of this entire process is what the theorem asserts.\n\nThus, the lemma states that the cosine function is continuous when considered as a function from the real numbers to the real numbers.

The notation \"Iff.rfl\" in Lean4's syntax stands for \"if and only if reflexive,\" which indicates that the statement on the left-hand side of the \u2194 symbol is true if and only if the statement on the right-hand side is true, and this truth is self-evident or reflexive based on the definitions of the terms involved.\n\nTherefore, the proof simply relies on the definition of the subset relation. To prove that \\(I\\) is a subset of \\(J\\) (written as \\(I \\le J\\) or \\(I \\subseteq J\\)), we need to show that if any element \\(x\\) is in \\(I\\) (denoted as \\(x \\in I\\)), then it must also be in \\(J\\) (\\(x \\in J\\)). Conversely, if for every element \\(x\\) in \\(I\\), \\(x\\) is also found in \\(J\\), then it must be that \\(I\\) is a subset of \\(J\\).\n\nThis theorem and its proof underscore a fundamental principle in set theory: the definition of a subset is entirely based on the inclusion of elements from one set within another. No additional elements from outside the first set need to be considered, and the theorem's truth is derived directly from this basic definition.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Simplifies the expression by substituting `normSq` with `abs^2`, based on the equivalence between the square of the norm of a complex number and the square of its absolute value (`\u2190 normSq_eq_abs`).\n3. Utilizes the known continuity of the absolute value function (`continuous_abs`), and the mathematical property that the continuity of a function is preserved under exponentiation (in this case, squaring).\n4. Concludes that since the square of the absolute value (which is what `normSq` has been simplified to) is continuous, `normSq` itself is continuous.\n\nThe logical structure of the proof is centered around the application of known mathematical properties (like the continuity of the absolute value function and the preservation of continuity under certain operations) to deduce the continuity of the square of the norm function.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The theorem involves types from a mathematical structure related to \"boxes\" in a certain context (likely in integration theory or a similar mathematical field), and the concept of \"WithBot,\" which represents a type that can be either a bottom element (denoted as `\u22a5`) or a value of another specified type. The specific theorem to be translated is about the coercion (type conversion) of the bottom element in the context of \"WithBot\" applied to a \"Box\" type into a \"Set\" of functions from `\u03b9` to `\u211d` (real numbers), stating that this coercion results in the empty set.\n\nThe Lean4 theorem is annotated with `@[simp, norm_cast]`, which suggests it's intended for use in simplification and normalization involving type casting in Lean's proof engine.

In the context of Lean4, `rfl` indicates that the theorem's statement is true by definition or by the nature of the constructs involved. Therefore, the proof does not involve a series of logical steps or manipulations but rather the acknowledgment that, by the definitions of the types and operations involved, coercing the bottom element `\u22a5` in the context of `WithBot (Box \u03b9)` directly results in the empty set `\u2205`. This reflects the idea that the bottom element, when viewed as a set of such functions, corresponds to having no elements at all, which aligns with the conceptual understanding of the bottom element as representing an absence of value or the \"lowest\" possible value in a lattice of values, where it converts to the empty set in the context of sets of functions.\n\nThe alignment comment suggests that this theorem or its proof aligns with a similar or related theorem or concept in the specified modules or libraries within Lean4, indicating a consistency or shared understanding across different parts of the Lean4 mathematical libraries or frameworks.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The lemma asserts that `equivRealProd` is a uniform embedding. \n\n# Proof:\nTo prove this, the statement relies on two key properties:\n\n1. **Antilipschitz Property of `equivRealProd`**: This part of the proof asserts that `equivRealProd` satisfies the antilipschitz condition, which is one of the requirements for a mapping to be considered a uniform embedding. An antilipschitz condition essentially means there exists a constant \\(C > 0\\) such that for all \\(x, y\\) in the domain, the distance between `equivRealProd(x)` and `equivRealProd(y)` is greater than or equal to \\(C\\) times the distance between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). This ensures that the mapping does not bring points too close together relative to their original spacing.\n\n2. **Lipschitz Continuity of `equivRealProd`**: The second part of the proof establishes that `equivRealProd` is Lipschitz continuous. This means there exists a constant \\(K > 0\\) such that for all \\(x, y\\) in the domain, the distance between `equivRealProd(x)` and `equivRealProd(y)` is less than or equal to \\(K\\) times the distance between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Lipschitz continuity is a strong form of uniform continuity, which ensures that the mapping does not stretch distances between points too far apart relative to their original spacing.\n\nCombining these two properties, the proof concludes that `equivRealProd` is a uniform embedding. A uniform embedding requires both that the mapping is injective (one-to-one) on a metric space and that both the mapping and its inverse are uniformly continuous. The antilipschitz condition implies a form of injectivity and lower bounds the expansion of distances, while Lipschitz continuity provides an upper bound. Together, they ensure the mapping respects the distances between points in a uniform manner, thus fulfilling the conditions for being a uniform embedding.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The lemma asserts that the `normSq` function is \"proper\" in a specific sense: it tends to infinity (`atTop`) when it is applied to inputs that are becoming infinitely large in any direction in the complex plane. This is formalized by saying that the function `normSq` tends towards `atTop` when restricted to the `cocompact` subset of the complex numbers. The cocompact topology, in this context, refers to the topology where a set is closed if and only if its complement is compact. In simpler terms, this theorem is stating that as the input values to `normSq` grow in magnitude without bound, the outputs of the function also grow without bound.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem utilizes a couple of key strategies and leverages another result regarding the behavior of the absolute value function, `abs`, on the complex numbers. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Simplification using `mul_self_abs`**: The proof begins by simplifying the `normSq` function. The simplification presumably relates to expressing the squared norm (or magnitude squared) of a complex number in terms of the square of its absolute value, which is what `mul_self_abs` suggests (`normSq` of a complex number is essentially the square of its absolute value).\n\n2. **Utilization of `tendsto_abs_cocompact_atTop`**: The core argument involves showing that the absolute value function, `abs`, tends to infinity (`atTop`) for inputs from the `cocompact` subset of \u2102. This result is stated as `tendsto_abs_cocompact_atTop`. It means that as complex numbers get arbitrarily large in any direction, their absolute values (magnitudes) also become arbitrarily large.\n\n3. **Multiplication Argument**: The final step involves an application of a multiplication rule for limits, specifically `atTop_mul_atTop`. This rule states that if two functions both tend towards infinity, their product also tends towards infinity. In this context, the function in question (`normSq`) is conceptualized as involving such a multiplication (since squaring is a special case of multiplication), and thus, since the absolute value tends to infinity, so does the square of the absolute value (which is what `normSq` computes).\n\nIn conclusion, the proof combines a simplification of the `normSq` function to relate it to the square of the absolute value, leverages the known behavior of the absolute value function in the cocompact topology of \u2102, and concludes that therefore, the `normSq` function must also tend to infinity under these conditions.

An injective function, often called a one-to-one function, means that if the function assigns two different elements the same value, then those two elements must be identical. In this specific context, the function takes an element of type `Box \u03b9` (representing a multidimensional box in \u211d to the power of \u03b9) and maps it to a set of real-valued functions indexed by \u03b9. The theorem suggests that no two distinct multidimensional boxes get mapped to the same set of functions.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof begins by introducing two arbitrary boxes, denoted as `\u27e8l\u2081, u\u2081, h\u2081\u27e9` and `\u27e8l\u2082, u\u2082, h\u2082\u27e9`, where `l` and `u` represent the lower and upper bounds of the boxes, respectively, and `h` indicates that each box is non-empty (i.e., each lower bound is less than the corresponding upper bound).\n\n1.

The `simp only [Subset.antisymm_iff, coe_subset_coe, le_iff_bounds] at h` line simplifies the hypothesis using only the specified lemmas or rules. This simplification involves understanding that the equality of sets derived from boxes implies each set is a subset of the other (`Subset.antisymm_iff`), which is further interpreted in terms of the bounds of the boxes (`le_iff_bounds`). The coercion to set (`coe_subset_coe`) plays a critical role in interpreting the hypothesis in terms of set inclusion.\n\n3. The `congr` command prepares to demonstrate that the two boxes are identical by showing their components are equal.

Convexity here is defined in the usual sense that for any two points within the set, the line segment connecting these points lies entirely within the set.\n\nIn simpler terms, the lemma asserts that any line segment drawn between any two points in the entire space `E` will always lie entirely within the space. This is proven by leveraging the broader principle that the space is star convex, which, by definition, ensures that line segments between points and a central point remain within the space, thereby satisfying the condition for convexity.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In the context of complex numbers, 0 can be thought of as 0 + 0i, where the real part is 0 and the imaginary part is also 0.\n\n2. **Proof Method**: The proof is performed by demonstrating that the function `conj`, when applied to 0, yields 0. This is shown through `coe_injective (map_zero conj')`, which is a technical way of asserting the proof based on the properties of the `conj` function and the behavior of zero under this function.\n   \n    - **`coe_injective`**: This part of the proof uses the property of injectivity of a certain coercion function. In simpler terms, it uses the fact that a certain type-converting function (here implied to be related to complex numbers) does not map two different inputs to the same output. This is important because it ensures that if the complex conjugate of 0 is shown to be 0 under this function, the result is uniquely determined and accurate.\n    \n    - **`map_zero conj'`**: This indicates that applying the `conj` function to 0 results in 0. `map_zero` is a principle that states the function in question (here, `conj`, which is likely a variant or related function of the standard complex conjugate function) preserves the zero element, meaning that applying it to zero yields zero.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The proof, thus, establishes that the complex conjugate of the number 0 is indeed 0, utilizing the properties of the complex conjugation function and the specific behaviors of zero with respect to this function.

Essentially, it breaks down the proof into showing that if the slightly modified version of the sequence tends to 0, then the original sequence does as well.\n\n3. **Applying Known Results**: The core of the proof involves applying a known result about sequences, `tendsto_add_atTop_iff_nat`. This result is adapted to the sequence in question by specifying a shift of 1 in the sequence's indexing. It effectively states that adding 1 to each \\(n\\) in the sequence \\(f(n) = \\frac{1}{n+1}\\) does not change the limit of the sequence.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By applying the theorem `tendsto_const_div_atTop_nhds_zero_nat`, the proof concludes that the sequence indeed tends to 0 as \\(n\\) approaches infinity.

It uses a function from the intervals to demonstrate the subset relation, applying an interval subset lemma or function (`Ioc_subset_Ioc`) to each point in \\(I\\) to show it belongs to \\(J\\), based on the bounds established in statement 4.\n\n- The proof concludes with `tfae_finish`, which wraps up the proof by asserting that all the statements have been shown to be equivalent given the logical steps taken.\n\nIn natural language, the theorem and proof establish a rigorous logical structure showing that certain relational properties about intervals and subsets within the real numbers and functions from an index set to the real numbers are logically equivalent, offering a foundational piece for further mathematical reasoning in the realm of real analysis and set theory.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

We start by applying the theorem `strictConvexOn_of_slope_strict_mono_adjacent` to the whole real line (`convex_univ`). This theorem says that a function is strictly convex on an interval if its slope (or derivative) is strictly increasing on that interval.\n\n2. To show the increasing nature of the slope, we consider three points `x`, `y`, and `z` on the real line, with `x < y < z`. We need to demonstrate that the slope of the function between `x` and `y` is less than the slope of the function between `y` and `z`.\n\n3. First, we focus on the interval between `x` and `y`. We establish two facts: `0 < y - x` and `x - y < 0`. These facts follow from the order of `x` and `y` (`x < y`).\n\n4. Next, we examine the change in the function (`exp`) between `x` and `y`. Using the properties of the exponential function, we rewrite `exp(y) - exp(x)` as `exp(y) * (1 - exp(x - y))`. \n\n5. We then show that `1 - exp(x - y)` is less than `-(x - y)`, which follows from the fact that `exp(x - y)` is always greater than `1 + (x - y)` when `x - y < 0`. This inequality is a consequence of the fact that the exponential function grows faster than linear functions.\n\n6. As a result, `exp(y) * (1 - exp(x - y))` is less than `exp(y) * (y - x)`, establishing that the slope between `x` and `y` is less than the difference `y - x`.\n\n7.

This is a way to define a facet as a maximal face in the context of simplicial complexes, meaning that it's a face that isn't contained within any larger face.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is referenced by `mem_sep_iff`, which is likely a previously established lemma or theorem that provides a general mechanism for proving membership relations involving sets and conditions.

Conversely, assume that `s` satisfies both conditions on the right side of the `\u2194` symbol: it's a member of `K.faces`, and for all `t` in `K.faces`, if `s` is a subset of `t`, then `s` equals `t`. This essentially means that `s` cannot be a proper subset of any other face, making it a maximal face and, by definition, a facet of `K`.\n\nThus, using the principle encapsulated in `mem_sep_iff`, we establish the equivalence stated in the theorem `mem_facets`.

The transition from strict convexity to convexity is justified because a function that is strictly convex is also convex by definition. Strict convexity implies that for any two points in the domain of the function, the function's graph will lie strictly below the straight line segment connecting the points, except at the ends.

It utilizes the `opNorm_le_bound` lemma, which stipulates that to prove an upper bound for the operator norm, one must provide a non-negative real number (`le_rfl` indicates `0` in this context) and show that for any vector `x` in `E`, the norm of the operator applied to `x` is less than or equal to this non-negative number multiplied by the norm of `x`. In the case of the zero operator, the right side of this inequality simplifies to `0`, since the zero operator sends any vector to the zero vector in `F`, and the norm of the zero vector is `0`. This simplification is achieved with the `simp` tactic, which automatically simplifies expressions based on known rules and definitions.\n\n2. **Non-Negativity (`opNorm_nonneg`):** This step establishes that the norm of the zero operator is non-negative.

Specifically, it leverages an established result or tool named `starAddEquiv` which, although not detailed in the statement, can be inferred to relate to the `star` operation in a way that is significant for the proof. The strategy is to demonstrate that `starAddEquiv` itself embodies the criteria for an isometry, which by extension, substantiates that the `star` operation is an isometry.\n\n1. **Starting Point:** The proof begins with the intention to show that `star` is an isometry by leveraging the `starAddEquiv`.\n   \n2. **Utilizing `starAddEquiv`:** The core of the argument involves the `starAddEquiv`.

This is done through the invocation of a principle or lemma (`AddMonoidHomClass.isometry_of_norm`) which likely establishes criteria under which a given operation can be considered an isometry if it preserves the norm.\n\n4. **Norm Preservation:** The critical piece of the proof hinges on the assertion that for any element `x`, the norm of `x` after applying the `star` operation (`\u2016x\u22c6\u2016`) is equal to the norm of `x` before its application (`\u2016x\u2016`).

The theorem being discussed states that the empty set (\u2205) is an upper set. \n\n# Proof:\nThe proof provided in Lean4 syntax for this theorem is quite straightforward and relies on the definition of an upper set. Let's break it down:\n\n- `IsUpperSet (\u2205 : Set \u03b1)`: This denotes the proposition that the empty set, denoted as `\u2205` and explicitly typed as a set of elements of type \u03b1 (`Set \u03b1`), is an upper set.\n\n- `fun _ _ _ => id`: This is a function that represents the proof of the proposition. In Lean4, `fun` is used to define anonymous functions, which are functions without a name. The underscores (`_`) are placeholders for the arguments that the function can take, implying that the specific arguments do not matter for the proof. The `id` part of the function is the identity function, which simply returns whatever is given to it.\n\nTranslating this into natural language, the proof goes as follows:\n\n\"To prove that the empty set is an upper set, consider any elements `x` and `y` such that `x` is in the empty set and `x \u2264 y`. Since the premise is impossible\u2014there are no elements in the empty set to begin with\u2014the condition that if `x \u2264 y` then `y` must also be in the set is trivially satisfied by the identity principle.

By definition, any element you choose in the universal set, every other element (including itself and those greater than it, according to the order relation) is also in the universal set because the universal set contains all elements.\n\n4. **Concluding the Proof**: The identity function in the proof (`id`) effectively states that we don't need to perform any further operations or checks to establish that the universal set is an upper set. This is because, by its very nature, the universal set trivially satisfies the conditions of being an upper set, as it contains every possible element, including all elements greater than any given element in the set.\n\nIn summary, the theorem asserts and the proof confirms, in a straightforward manner, that the universal set is an upper set because it inherently contains every element, including all elements greater than any of its members.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

A set \\(S\\) is a lower set if, whenever an element \\(x\\) is in \\(S\\) and \\(x\\) is less than or equal to another element \\(y\\), then \\(y\\) must also be in \\(S\\).\n\n2. **Universal Set Characteristic**: The universal set, by its very definition, contains every possible element. Therefore, any element \\(y\\), regardless of how it is chosen or defined, is included in the universal set.\n\n3. **Applying the Definition to the Universal Set**: The theorem `isLowerSet_univ` asserts that the universal set is a lower set. To prove this, consider any elements \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) where \\(x \\leq y\\). Since \\(y\\) is an element (and because every element is part of the universal set by definition), \\(y\\) is in the universal set. This scenario applies to any elements \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), demonstrating that the universal set indeed satisfies the condition to be considered a lower set.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The function `fun _ _ _ => id` in the Lean4 proof essentially states that for any elements you pick, the condition that defines a lower set is trivially satisfied because every element by definition belongs to the universal set. This is a direct application of the universal set's all-encompassing nature, requiring no further conditions or qualifications to prove that it is a lower set.\n\nIn natural language, the lemma and its proof convey that the universal set is inherently a lower set because it contains every element by definition, making the condition for being a lower set automatically fulfilled for every possible pair of elements.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In mathematical terms, an upper set within a partially ordered set is a set where, for any element `x` in the set, if there is another element `y` such that `x \u2264 y` (meaning `x` is less than or equal to `y`), then `y` is also in the set.

The statement asserts an equivalence between an antitone function composed with the operation of taking the dual on a set \\(s\\), and a monotone function on the same set \\(s\\). Specifically, it states that a function \\(f\\) composed with the operation of taking the dual of its input (\\(f \\circ \\text{ofDual}\\)) is antitone on a set \\(s\\) if and only if \\(f\\) itself is monotone on \\(s\\).\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof relies on the concept of swapping the arguments in a universally quantified biconditional statement, a technique known as `forall\u2082_swap`. In the context of this theorem, the swapping relates to the logical equivalence of antitonicity and monotonicity under the composition with taking the dual. \n\nAntitonicity means that for any two elements \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in the set \\(s\\), if \\(x \\leq y\\) then \\(f(x) \\geq f(y)\\). Monotonicity, on the other hand, means that if \\(x \\leq y\\), then \\(f(x) \\leq f(y)\\). The operation of taking the dual of an element essentially reverses the order, turning an antitone function into a monotone function and vice versa when considering the function's behavior on the set \\(s\\).\n\nThe logical structure underlying the proof is that by applying the concept of taking the dual to both sides of an inequality, one can convert statements about antitonic functions into statements about monotone functions. This is because the dual of a greater-than-or-equal-to relationship is a less-than-or-equal-to relationship, and vice versa. The lemma `forall\u2082_swap` effectively demonstrates this conversion by showing that the two conditions\u2014being antitone after composing with the dual, and being monotone\u2014are logically equivalent when considering their action on the set \\(s\\).\n\nThus, the proof doesn't involve step-by-step traditional mathematical manipulation or calculation but instead employs a higher-order logic reasoning to establish the equivalence of two properties under specific operations.

The notation `h <| le_succ _` utilizes a function `h` that, given the assumption `IsMax a`, leverages the property of `a` being maximal to infer `succ a \u2264 a`.

It claims that lifting a type to the universe level `max u v` and then to `u` is equivalent to directly lifting it to the universe level `v` and then to `u`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof proceeds by extending a function across all elements (`a`) of a certain type, invoking the principle of induction on those elements. This approach is typical in type theory, where proving properties about all instances of a type often involves assuming the property holds for an arbitrary instance and then showing it holds universally.\n\n1. **Functional Extensionality**: The proof starts with the application of functional extensionality (`funext`), which allows us to prove the equality of two functions by showing that they give the same result for all inputs. Here, it is used to compare the two ways of lifting.\n\n2. **Induction on `a`**: The next step involves using the `inductionOn` method on an arbitrary element `a`. This step is crucial for handling types inductively, implying that the proof will hold for any element of the type being considered.\n\n3. **Application of Equivalences**: The core of the proof lies in showing that the two ways of lifting (`lift.{max u v, u}` and `lift.{v, u}`) are equivalent by employing a sequence of equivalences. Specifically, `Equiv.ulift` is used, which is an equivalence that lifts types to a higher universe level. The proof uses this equivalence and its symmetry (`Equiv.ulift.symm`) to establish that the cardinality (or size) of the types remains unchanged regardless of the lifting path taken.\n\n4. **Equality of Cardinalities**: The final step involves showing that the two paths of lifting result in types of the same cardinality. This is encapsulated in the statement `(Equiv.ulift.trans Equiv.ulift.symm).cardinal_eq`, indicating that the composition of `Equiv.ulift` and its inverse (`Equiv.ulift.symm`) leads to an equivalence that preserves cardinality, thereby proving the theorem.\n\nIn essence, this lemma and its proof in Lean4 highlight a property of type lifting in type theory: the specific path taken to elevate a type to a higher universe level (in terms of the order of universe levels involved) does not affect the end result, at least in terms of the cardinality of the type.

However, the latter possibility leads to a contradiction, as shown in subsequent steps, thus affirming the existence of the former.\n\n2. **Assuming the Contrary for a Contradiction**: It assumes, for contradiction, that there is an embedding from `Cardinal.{u}` to `\u03c3`, represented by a function `f` with a corresponding property `hf` indicating that `f` is an embedding.\n\n3. **Inverse Function Construction**: An inverse function `g : \u03c3 \u2192 Cardinal.{u}` is constructed for `f`. This is possible because `f` is an embedding, implying that for each cardinal number, there's a unique element in `\u03c3` mapped to it by `f`.\n\n4. **Cantor's Diagonal Argument**: The proof then employs a version of Cantor's diagonal argument by selecting a specific cardinal number, `2 ^ sum g`, which cannot be in the range of `g` due to Cantor's theorem. This is where `g x = 2 ^ sum g` comes into play, showing a contradiction because it implies that such a cardinal number is indeed in the range of `g`.\n\n5. **Deriving a Contradiction**: It is established that `g x`, the image of some `x` in `\u03c3`, cannot be greater than the sum of all images under `g` (`sum g`).

This is an important property in mathematics, particularly in the context of series and algebra, showcasing how multiplying by zero simplifies to zero, consistent with fundamental algebraic principles.\n\n# Proof: Understanding the Lean4 Proof\n\nThe proof provided in Lean4's syntax involves several key components, articulated into natural language as follows:\n\n1. **Goal Statement**: The theorem `mul_zero` aims to prove that multiplying any multivariable power series (`\u03c6`) by `0` results in the `0` power series. This is formally stated as `\u03c6 * 0 = 0`.\n\n2. **Proof Strategy**: The proof utilizes a method known as extensionality (`ext`), which in this context means showing that for all indices `n`, the coefficients of the resulting power series on both sides of the equation are the same. This is a common approach in formal proofs involving functions or series, where proving that all corresponding outputs are equal underpins the equality of the functions or series themselves.\n\n3. **Execution of Proof**:\n   - The `fun n =>` part signifies that the proof will proceed by considering an arbitrary term `n` in the series. This is a way of saying, \"Let's look at any given term in the power series.\"\n   - The `by classical` part indicates that the proof will use classical reasoning, a mode of logic where the law of excluded middle holds. This is standard in many areas of mathematics, allowing for certain types of indirect proofs that are not constructively valid.\n   - The `simp [coeff_mul]` part uses a simplification tactic with the specific hint `coeff_mul`, which likely refers to a predefined rule or lemma about how coefficients behave under multiplication in the context of power series. This tactic attempts to simplify the goal by applying known rules, reducing it to simpler forms or even solving it outright.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By applying classical reasoning and simplification tactics focused on the behavior of coefficients in multiplication, the proof concludes that the coefficient of any term `n` in the power series resulting from `\u03c6 * 0` is equal to `0`, hence proving the original statement that `\u03c6 * 0 = 0`.\n\nThis proof leverages the principles of extensionality and simplification within the formal framework of Lean4, effectively demonstrating a fundamental property of power series multiplication in a rigorous, formalized manner.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This concludes the proof by establishing the initially stated equivalence, thus proving the theorem.\n\nThe logical structure of the proof involves establishing a known or given condition (`Set.singleton_one` equivalent to `{1}`), applying a fundamental theorem or principle about the span of a singleton set containing 1, and concluding that the span of such a set is the entire space.

In lattice theory, a complete lattice is a type of lattice in which all subsets have both a supremum (join) and an infimum (meet). An element is considered compact if, for any directed set whose supremum exceeds the compact element, there is at least one element in the directed set that already exceeds the compact element.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof leverages a simplification strategy (`simpa only`) along with a specific lemma (`span_singleton_one`) to establish the compactness of the top element.

This is an application of a broader principle or result to a specific instance, here using the properties of spans and singletons within the framework of lattice theory to deduce properties about the top element in a lattice of ideals.\n\nIn essence, the proof methodologically reduces the assertion about the top element being compact to a known fact about the compactness of a specific kind of span in a submodule, leveraging lattice-theoretic properties to bridge between these concepts.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Essentially, it's asserting that `1` is a generating element for the entire space.\n\n2. **The Approach (`(eq_top_iff_one _).2`)**: The proof begins by invoking a principle or lemma, not explicitly detailed here, which likely states something along the lines of \"A space equals the whole space (`\u22a4`) if and only if `1` belongs to it and can be obtained by the elements within that space.\" The `.2` refers to applying the second part of this principle, which is the \"if\" direction (if `1` is obtainable from the elements of the set, then the set spans the whole space).\n\n3. **Justifying the Approach (`subset_span <| mem_singleton _`)**: To justify the application of the aforementioned principle, the proof shows that `1` is indeed an element that can be obtained from the span of `{1}`, which seems somewhat tautological but is necessary for formal proof. This is done by demonstrating that `1` is in the singleton set `{1}` (`mem_singleton _`) and therefore is in the span of `{1}` (`subset_span`).

Second, if \\(y\\) is coprime to \\(x\\), then \\(x\\) is coprime to \\(y\\). The proof utilizes the symmetry property of the coprimeness relation.\n\n1. **First implication (\\(\\Rightarrow\\)):** Assume that \\(x\\) is coprime to \\(y\\). By the definition of coprimeness, this means that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is 1. Since the GCD of \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) is the same as the GCD of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) due to the commutative property of GCD, \\(y\\) is coprime to \\(x\\).

Let's break down the components of the proof provided in Lean4's syntax for clarity:\n\n1. **Commute the arguments of the coprimality function:** The statement starts by applying the commutativity of the coprimality function `IsCoprime`.

This theorem likely states that \\(0\\) and \\(x\\) are coprime if and only if \\(x\\) is a unit. This directly aligns with the definition of coprime numbers: two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1, and the only numbers that can have a GCD of 1 with \\(0\\) are the units (again, in the context of integers, \\(1\\) and \\(-1\\)).\n\nIn natural language, the proof essentially says: \"For any number \\(x\\), \\(x\\) and \\(0\\) are coprime if and only if \\(x\\) is a unit.

So, if `S` and `T` are subrings of `R`, and `S` is a subset of `T`, then the submonoid of `S` is a subset of the submonoid of `T`.\n\n2. **Application of `toSubmonoid_strictMono.monotone`**: The proof asserts that the strict monotonicity of `toSubmonoid` implies its monotonicity. This is a direct application of the mathematical principle that a strictly monotone function is also monotone. The strict monotonicity of the `toSubmonoid` function had been established elsewhere (presumably by `toSubmonoid_strictMono`), which ensures that if one subring is strictly contained within another, then their corresponding submonoids maintain this relationship.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: By leveraging the strict monotonicity of the `toSubmonoid` mapping, the theorem concludes that this mapping is indeed monotone. This formalizes an important property about the structure-preserving nature of the function from subrings to submonoids within the algebraic framework of ring theory.\n\nIn summary, the theorem `toSubmonoid_mono` formalizes the intuitive idea that the inclusion relation between subrings of a ring `R` is preserved when considering their corresponding submonoids. This preservation of order is a fundamental aspect of the algebraic structure and is critical for various proofs and constructions in ring theory and its applications.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The statement asserts that the function `toAddSubgroup`, which maps each subring of \\(R\\) to its corresponding additive subgroup, is strictly monotonic. In other words, if one subring is properly contained within another, then the additive subgroup associated with the first subring is also properly contained within the additive subgroup associated with the second subring.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof provided in the Lean4 syntax is minimal and relies on the intrinsic properties of the `toAddSubgroup` function and the definitions of strict monotonicity and algebraic structures involved. \n\nTo translate this into a natural language explanation:\n\n1. **Starting Point:** We begin with the function `toAddSubgroup` that takes any subring of \\(R\\) and returns its additive subgroup.

Specifically, it asserts that the submodule generated by the `adjoin` of `s` in `R` is exactly equal to the `span` of `R` over the `closure` of `s`. This is a foundational result connecting the concepts of algebraic adjoin and span in ring theory, showing how elements algebraically adjoined to a ring from a set `s` span the same subspace as the closure of `s`.\n\n# Proof: \nThe proof employs the `le_antisymm` theorem to establish equality by proving two inclusions: that the submodule of the `adjoin` of `s` is a subset of the `span` of the closure of `s`, and vice versa.\n\n1. **First inclusion (Subalgebra to Submodule is within Span):** It begins by taking an arbitrary element `r` from the submodule of the adjoin of `s`, demonstrating that `r` can be expressed as a linear combination of elements from the closure of `s`. This is shown by:\n   - Decomposing `r` into a list of elements (`L`) that, when combined through algebraic operations (specifically, scalar multiplication and addition), yield `r`.\n   - Using induction on this list, it shows that for the base case (an empty list), the result trivially belongs to the span as the zero element. \n   - For the inductive step, it assumes the result for a list of length `n` and proves it for `n+1` by showing that the head of the list, when processed with algebraic operations, can be included in the span.

Localization is a process that allows us to invert certain elements in a ring, essentially creating a new ring where these elements have multiplicative inverses.

A unit in a ring is an element that has a multiplicative inverse within that ring.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof is indicated as `IsLocalization.map_units'`. This suggests that the proof utilizes a previously proven theorem or lemma named `map_units'` within the context or module `IsLocalization`. The actual proof mechanism isn't detailed here, but the reference implies that `IsLocalization.map_units'` has established the necessary conditions or arguments to conclude that the image of any element `y` from the subset `M` under the given algebraic map (algebraMap) is indeed a unit in the ring `S`.\n\nTo further break it down:\n- `\u2200 y : M` signifies \"for all `y` belonging to the subset `M`\",\n- `IsUnit (algebraMap R S y)` denotes that the image of `y` under the algebraic mapping from `R` to `S` is a unit (has a multiplicative inverse) in `S`.\n\nThus, the lemma and its proof in natural language can be summarized as: For any element of a certain subset within a ring, when we apply a specific ring homomorphism to this element, the result is an element in the target ring that has an inverse.

Witt vectors are a sophisticated construction in algebraic geometry and number theory, providing a systematic way to construct ring extensions and study their properties. This particular theorem emphasizes the idea that the mapping function preserves the identity element of the Witt vector ring under certain conditions.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof is conducted using the tactic `map_fun_tac`, which is a strategy in Lean4 designed to automate the reasoning process for functions applied to Witt vectors. The essence of this tactic is to reduce the problem to simpler components that are already known or easier to prove, based on the definitions and properties of map functions and Witt vectors.\n\nIn natural language, the proof would proceed by showing that:\n1. The map function \\(f\\) is applied to each component of the Witt vector. Since Witt vectors are infinite sequences with elements from the ring \\(R\\), the mapping function is applied element-wise across these sequences.\n2. For the specific Witt vector representing the number 1, its structure is such that all components are designed to preserve the ring's multiplicative identity through the mapping process. In the case of the number 1, this would mean that \\(f(1) = 1\\) if \\(f\\) preserves ring identities.\n3. The `map_fun_tac` tactic leverages these properties, along with the definitions of map functions and the algebraic structure of Witt vectors, to conclude that the mapped Witt vector of 1 still equals 1.\n\nThus, the proof fundamentally relies on understanding the behavior of map functions on the algebraic structure of Witt vectors and the preservation of the identity element within this context. The tactical application simplifies the verification by employing known lemmas and properties surrounding Witt vectors and their interactions with map functions.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Specifically, it uses the fact that the 0th coefficient can be considered a \"single\" element at position 0, which, due to the nature of power series, corresponds directly to the constant coefficient.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The proof concludes with `rfl`, which in Lean4 means that the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the equation are exactly the same by definition. This reflects that the operation of obtaining the coefficient of the 0th term directly equates to the operation of obtaining the constant coefficient in a power series within the ring \\(R\\).\n\nThus, the theorem `coeff_zero_eq_constantCoeff` articulates a fundamental property of power series in the context of coefficient access, specifically asserting that the process to fetch the constant term's coefficient is inherently the same as directly accessing the constant coefficient.

A UFD is a domain where every non-zero element can be uniquely factored into irreducible elements, up to order and units (elements with multiplicative inverses).\n\n# Proof:\n\nThe proof proceeds by leveraging the properties of the integral domain `R` and its element `p`, which is given to be irreducible and satisfies the condition that every non-zero element in `R` is associated with a power of `p`. \n\n1. **Selection of `p`:** The proof begins by choosing an irreducible element `p` in `R`, which is possible by the hypothesis of the theorem. \n\n2. **Use of `spec`:** It utilizes a specification `spec`, derived from the hypothesis `hR` that establishes `p`'s properties, including its irreducibility and the association of every non-zero element in `R` to a power of `p`.\n\n3. **Main argument to show UFD:** To demonstrate that `R` is a UFD, the proof shows that every non-zero element `x` in `R` has a prime factorization. This is done by constructing a multiset of `p` raised to a certain power, which is dictated by the non-zero element `x`'s association with a power of `p`.

For a multiplicative monoid, this identity element is 1, and for an additive monoid (referred to as `AddSubmonoid`), this identity element is 0.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this lemma is quite straightforward and relies on the intrinsic property of a submonoid. By definition, a submonoid must satisfy two main criteria: it must contain the identity element of the parent monoid, and it must be closed under the monoid operation. The lemma specifically addresses the first criterion.\n\nFor the multiplicative monoid, the lemma asserts that 1, the identity element, is a member of the submonoid `S`.

Specifically, applying a monoid homomorphism to the closure of a set yields the same result as closing the image of the set under the homomorphism.

A monoid is an algebraic structure with a single associative binary operation and an identity element. In this case, the statement is about the monoids \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) and their monoid homomorphisms to a product monoid \\(M * N\\). Specifically, it says that the monoid homomorphism image (or range) of \\(M\\) under the inclusion map to \\(M * N\\) combined with the monoid homomorphism image of \\(N\\) under its inclusion map to \\(M * N\\) spans the entire product monoid \\(M * N\\).\n\n# Proof:\n\nThe proof follows these steps, translating the Lean4 syntax into natural language:\n\n1. **Use of Monoid Homomorphism Range to Describe the Problem:**\n   The problem starts with the observation that the range (denoted as `mrange`) of the monoid homomorphism from \\(M\\) to \\(M * N\\) (denoted as `inl` for inclusion of the left part) combined with (`\u2294` symbolizing the sup or join operation in lattice theory) the range of the monoid homomorphism from \\(N\\) to \\(M * N\\) (denoted as `inr` for inclusion of the right part) is equal to the top element (`\u22a4`) of the lattice structure of submonoids of \\(M * N\\), which in this context is the whole product monoid \\(M * N\\).\n\n2. **Rewriting Using Closure and Union:**\n   The proof proceeds by rewriting this statement in terms of the closure of the union of the images of `inl` and `inr`. The notation `mclosure_range_inl_union_inr` suggests the use of monoid closure (the smallest submonoid containing a set) of the range of the union of `inl` and `inr`. The statement is transformed to equate this closure to the top element of the lattice, indicating completeness or that the entire space of \\(M * N\\) is spanned.\n\n3. **Decomposition into Submonoid Closure:**\n   The proof decomposes this further by expressing the closure of the union as the union of closures (`Submonoid.closure_union`). This step relies on properties of submonoids and their closures in a monoid, particularly how unions of sets within a monoid translate into submonoid closures.\n\n4. **Reinterpreting Monoid Homomorphism Range:**\n   The next step reinterprets the monoid homomorphism range (`MonoidHom.mrange`) in terms of submonoid closure (`Submonoid.closure_eq`). This step is crucial because it connects the concept of a homomorphism's image with the abstract algebraic structure of closures within monoids, grounding the proof in foundational mathematical principles.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   The conclusion of the proof asserts that by understanding the monoid homomorphism ranges as closures and applying properties of submonoids and their operations, the initial statement about the combination of the ranges of \\(M\\) and \\(N\\) under their respective inclusion maps covering the entire product monoid \\(M * N\\) holds true.

A subsingleton is a set that contains at most one element. In essence, the theorem posits that the set `s` has the property that its elements are pairwise disjoint with respect to `\u22a5` if and only if `s` is a subsingleton.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof is structured as a bidirectional implication, meaning that it proves two directions: from the property of being pairwise disjoint to being a subsingleton, and vice versa.\n\n1. **From pairwise disjoint to subsingleton**: The first direction of the proof starts with the assumption that `s` is pairwise disjoint with respect to `\u22a5`. Given any two elements `_a` and `_b` from `s`, if they are assumed to be different, the pairwise disjoint property should imply they relate through `\u22a5`. However, since `\u22a5` essentially indicates a \"no relation\" or an impossibility of coexistence in a meaningful relationship, this leads to a contradiction, implying `_a` and `_b` must be the same. This satisfies the definition of a subsingleton, as we can't find two distinct elements in `s`.\n\n2. **From subsingleton to pairwise disjoint**: The second direction assumes `s` is a subsingleton, which means it contains at most one element. Under this assumption, the theorem shows that `s` is pairwise disjoint with respect to `\u22a5`. Since there are not two distinct elements in `s` to contradict the property of being pairwise disjoint, this direction is trivially true. Any two elements you pick (if you can even find two) must be the same, and thus, the property of being disjoint with `\u22a5` holds vacuously because there's no second distinct element to compare against.\n\nIn conclusion, the lemma and its proof establish a precise equivalence: a set of elements is pairwise disjoint with respect to a minimal or non-existent relationship (`\u22a5`) if and only if it is a subsingleton.

The reasoning here is that since inversion is its own inverse, applying it to set \\(s\\) (to get \\(\\text{Inv.inv} '' s\\)) maps each element to its inverse, which is precisely the operation needed to obtain the preimage of \\(s\\) under inversion, and thus, by the property of involutiveness, yields \\(s^{-1}\\).\n\n3. **Conclusion:** By applying the principle that the image of a set under an involutive function is equal to its preimage under the same function, and knowing that inversion is such a function, it follows logically that applying inversion to each element of set \\(s\\) results in the inverse set of \\(s\\), denoted as \\(s^{-1}\\). This conclusion is succinctly captured by the theorem statement `Inv.inv '' s = s\u207b\u00b9`, asserting the equality of the set obtained by inverting each element of \\(s\\) and the inverse set of \\(s\\).\n\nIn summary, the theorem demonstrates a fundamental property of sets and operations in the context of mathematical structures, particularly focusing on the behavior of inversion and its effects on set elements.

This holds because the criteria for membership in these sets is symmetric or commutative, as demonstrated by `and_comm`.\n\nIn summary, the theorem and its proof convey that the operation of taking the dual of an interval reverses the order of the interval's bounds, and this reversal is precisely captured by the commutativity of the logical condition for element inclusion in these intervals.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The `Nat.lt_add_one_iff` property itself states that for any natural numbers `a` and `b`, the statement `a < b + 1` is equivalent to `a \u2264 b`.

This is a foundational concept in arithmetic and order theory.\n\n2. **Equivalence**: The core of the theorem states that for `a` to be less than `b + 1`, it is both necessary and sufficient for `a` to be less than or equal to `b`. This is because:\n   - If `a` is less than `b`, it is naturally less than `b + 1` (since adding 1 to `b` makes a number that is greater than `b`).\n   - If `a` equals `b`, it is again less than `b + 1` for the same reason.\n   - Conversely, if `a` is less than `b + 1`, it cannot be greater than `b` because `b + 1` is the immediate successor of `b` in the set of natural numbers, and there are no integers between `b` and `b + 1`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: This proof is built upon the intrinsic properties of natural numbers and their order relations. It elegantly demonstrates how a simple arithmetic operation (+1) can define a foundational comparison between numbers, encapsulated in the Lean4 theorem proving environment.

It states that the coercion function from a dependent function type (`\u03a0\u2080 i, \u03b2 i`) to a function type (`\u2200 i, \u03b2 i`) is injective. This means if we have two functions of type `\u03a0\u2080 i, \u03b2 i` (which can be thought of as functions that return values of type `\u03b2` indexed by `i`, but with some dependency on `i` potentially allowing for a more sparse or conditional definition), and if applying the coercion to these functions results in identical functions of type `\u2200 i, \u03b2 i` (which are regular functions from `i` to `\u03b2` without any conditions), then the original two functions must have been identical.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem leverages a previously established lemma, `DFunLike.coe_injective`, which asserts the injectivity of a similar coercion function but in a slightly different or more general context. Essentially, this lemma states that under certain conditions, if you have a way to coerce (convert) elements from one type to another such that the coercion is injective (meaning distinct inputs produce distinct outputs), then this property can be used to establish the injectivity of similar conversions.\n\nThe annotation `@[deprecated DFunLike.coe_injective]` might suggest that this specific instance of using `DFunLike.coe_injective` is deprecated, possibly because there are newer or more appropriate methods or lemmas to use. However, the core logical structure remains as follows:\n\n1. Assume you have two functions `f` and `g` of type `\u03a0\u2080 i, \u03b2 i` such that their coerced forms are equal, i.e., `\u21d1f = \u21d1g` when viewed as functions of type `\u2200 i, \u03b2 i`.\n2. Given the injectivity of the coercion (as established by `DFunLike.coe_injective`), it follows that `f = g`. This is because injectivity ensures that equal outputs (`\u21d1f` and `\u21d1g`) must come from equal inputs (`f` and `g`).\n\nTherefore, the theorem `coeFn_injective` is proven by directly applying the injectivity property of the coercion function, as previously proven by `DFunLike.coe_injective`. This establishes that the process of converting from a dependent function type to a regular function type via this specific coercion preserves distinctness: if the results of the coercion are the same, then the original dependent functions were the same.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This function underlies the implementation of addition within the data structure used to represent multivariate polynomials. Here's a breakdown of the proof steps, translated into natural language:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: The `C` function takes a constant (a scalar from the ring `R`) and returns a constant polynomial in the multivariate polynomial ring `MvPolynomial \u03c3 R`.

In the context of multivariate polynomials, `Finsupp.single` is a function that takes a scalar and returns a polynomial that is zero everywhere except at a single point, where it equals the scalar. The addition of these \"single point\" polynomials is handled in a way that mimics the addition of scalars, thanks to the properties of `Finsupp.single_add`.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By showing that `C (a + a')` and `C a + C a'` both ultimately rely on the additive properties of scalars within the polynomial representation (specifically through the `Finsupp.single_add` mechanism), the theorem concludes that these two expressions are indeed equal. This equality underscores the consistency of polynomial addition with scalar addition, as modeled in the `MvPolynomial \u03c3 R` structure.\n\nIn essence, the proof confirms that the process of creating constant polynomials and then adding them mirrors the algebraic process of adding constants first and then creating a polynomial, highlighting a fundamental aspect of the algebraic structure of multivariate polynomials.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In simpler terms, no two distinct vectors will have the same list representation after applying the `toList` function.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof leverages a fundamental property of injectivity but applied in the context of subtype projections. The term `Subtype.val_injective` refers to the injectivity of the `val` function for subtypes, which in this context is used to argue about the `toList` function's injectivity. Specifically, it asserts that since the underlying representation function (`val`, in this case) of vectors as lists is injective, the `toList` function itself is injective.\n\nIn more detail, the proof strategy does not involve direct manipulation or examination of the elements within the vectors or lists. Instead, it relies on a higher-order property: if the function that extracts the list from the vector subtype is injective (meaning it precisely preserves distinctness from vectors to lists), then the `toList` function, which essentially does the same thing, is also injective. This hinges on understanding that in Lean4 (like in many typed functional programming languages), a vector is implemented as a subtype of lists with additional constraints (e.g., a fixed length). The injectivity of the conversion from this subtype back to the generic list type ensures that no information is lost or conflated during the conversion, which is what's being exploited in this proof.\n\nThus, the logical structure of the argument is based on leveraging an existing injectivity property of subtype projections (here, from vectors to lists) to establish the injectivity of the `toList` function.

The `eq_iff` part suggests that the proof is based on demonstrating an equivalence (if and only if condition) between two statements about equality.\n\nThe `coe_injective` part implies that the coercion function, which is responsible for the conversion from entities to sets, is injective. An injective function is one that preserves distinctness; that is, if two inputs to the function are different, then their outputs must also be different. This property is crucial for the proof because it ensures that if the sets are equal after coercion (the outputs), then the entities themselves (the inputs) were equal before the coercion.\n\nBy relying on the injectivity of the coercion function (`coe_injective`), the theorem leverages the principle that if two entities are such that their coercions into sets are equal, then it must be the case that the entities themselves were equal. The `.eq_iff` indicates that this reasoning applies in both directions, thus establishing the equivalence needed for the theorem.\n\nIn essence, the proof argues that the equality of `p` and `q` as sets directly implies and is implied by the equality of `p` and `q` as original entities, without any loss of information or change in conditions due to the coercion process. This maintains the fidelity of the original mathematical reasoning by ensuring that the logical structure and content of the theorem in Lean4's syntax are preserved in the explanation.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

There are two main cases to consider based on the value of \\(j\\):\n\n1. **Case \\(j = 0\\)**: Here, we're looking at the first element of the tuple. The statement simplifies to showing that adding an element to the beginning of the tuple doesn't change when we update some other position in the tuple afterward. This is straightforward since the first element (at position 0) remains the same (the newly added element \\(x\\)), regardless of any updates to positions that come after it. This part of the proof uses the fact that the successor of any natural number \\(i\\) (representing our original update position) is not zero, ensuring that our update doesn't affect the first element.\n\n2. **Case \\(j \\neq 0\\)**: For positions other than the first, we adjust our indexing to account for the new element added at the beginning. We define \\(j'\\) as \\(j-1\\) to compensate for the added element at the start. We then show that updating position \\(j'\\) (after adding the new element at the beginning) is equivalent to updating position \\(j\\) before adding the new element. This part of the proof distinguishes further between whether \\(j'\\) (the adjusted index) is the original update position \\(i\\) or not:\n   - If \\(j'\\) is the update position \\(i\\), then updating \\(j'\\) or \\(i\\) in their respective scenarios directly applies, and the equivalence is straightforward.\n   - If \\(j'\\) is not the update position \\(i\\), we must show that updating at \\(j'\\) (or equivalently, \\(j\\)) doesn't interfere with the update at \\(i\\) in either scenario. This involves showing that the successor of \\(j'\\) is not the successor of \\(i\\), which ensures that updates to position \\(i\\) or \\(j'\\) are distinct and do not affect each other.\n\nThe proof methodically checks these cases using Lean's proof strategies, including rewriting with known identities, simplifying expressions, and leveraging the properties of functions like `succ` (successor) and `pred` (predecessor) to align with the logical structure of tuple updates and element insertions.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

It claims that this process is equivalent to directly adding `z` to the beginning of `p`, without the intermediate step involving `x`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is carried out by examining all possible positions `j` in the updated tuple. There are two cases to consider based on the position `j`:\n\n1. **Case `j = 0`:** This is the case where we are looking at the first element of the tuple.\n   - Here, we substitute `j` with `0` (denoted as `rw [h]`) and simplify. The simplification (`simp`) shows that after updating, the first element is indeed `z`, matching the right-hand side of our theorem which is `cons z p`.

This is a bit nuanced because of the way negation is used, so let's break it down: \n\n- `\u00aca = !b` means that negating `a` (`\u00aca` or \"not `a`\") is the same as applying the boolean negation of `b` (`!b` or \"not `b`\").\n- `a = b` simply means that `a` is equal to `b`.\n\nThe lemma posits that these two conditions are equivalent; that is, if `a` is not equal to `b`, then negating `a` yields the same result as negating `b`, and vice versa.\n\n# Proof: \nThe proof of this theorem is encapsulated by the `by decide` method in the Lean4 syntax, which effectively means that the theorem can be automatically proven by Lean's decision procedures.

In Lean4, a countable set `\u03b1` is represented by the existence of a surjection from `\u2115` to `\u03b1`, which means there's a function `f` from `\u2115` to `\u03b1` such that every element of `\u03b1` can be matched with at least one natural number. The assumption of `\u03b1` being countable gives us such a function `f` along with its property `hf` of being a surjection. From this, the proof directly constructs a nonempty embedding of `\u03b1` into `\u2115`, essentially reiterating the assumption that such a function `f` exists and satisfies the embedding criteria, which includes being an injection (a one-to-one mapping).\n\n2. **From Nonempty Embedding to Countable (`\u27f5`):**\n   The converse part assumes there exists a nonempty embedding of `\u03b1` into `\u2115`.

This part of the proof takes such a function `f` and concludes that `\u03b1` is countable. The injective nature of `f` ensures that `\u03b1` can be matched with a subset of `\u2115`, thereby making `\u03b1` countable, as being countable means that there exists some injection from the set into `\u2115`.\n\nThis proof employs the concept of embeddings to connect the idea of countability with the existence of certain types of functions, showcasing a foundational aspect of set theory and mathematical logic as formalized in Lean4.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

In simpler terms, this means that if we have two elements of type `Sym \u03b1 n` and after converting both to type `Multiset \u03b1` they turn out to be identical, then those two elements were originally identical in the `Sym \u03b1 n` type as well.\n\nThe type `Sym \u03b1 n` refers to a symmetric group of some type `\u03b1` with a certain size `n`, which essentially represents a collection of elements of type `\u03b1` arranged in a way that respects the symmetries of a structure with `n` elements. On the other hand, `Multiset \u03b1` represents a multiset of elements of type `\u03b1`, which is similar to a set but allows for multiple occurrences of the same element.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem relies on another theorem or lemma, `subtype.coe_injective`, which asserts that the coercion function (indicated by `coe`) is injective for subtypes.

This module provides tools and properties about multisets, which are collections that allow multiple instances of the same element. The theorem `mem_replicate` directly corresponds to the statement we're examining.\n\nHere's a step-by-step translation of the proof process in natural language, maintaining the logical structure and content of the original statement within the Lean4 framework:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: The theorem `mem_replicate` from the `Multiset` module is invoked. This theorem already encapsulates the logic necessary to prove our statement. It asserts that an element `b` is in the multiset resulting from replicating an element `a` `n` times if and only if two conditions are met: `n \u2260 0` and `b = a`.\n\n2. **Application of `mem_replicate`**: By invoking `Multiset.mem_replicate`, we apply a previously proven logical framework that matches our target statement. This strategy is common in mathematical proofs, where known theorems are utilized to establish the veracity of new statements.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The application of `Multiset.mem_replicate` directly leads us to the conclusion that for `b` to be a member of the list (or multiset, in a more general sense) generated by replicating `a` `n` times, it must be true that `n` is not zero and `b` must be equal to `a`. This conclusion is drawn not by rederiving the underlying principles but by applying the established theorem `mem_replicate`.\n\nThus, the natural language translation faithfully represents the logic and reasoning of the original Lean4 theorem and proof, clearly stating the conditions under which an element belongs to a list generated by replication.

The use of `Multiset.eq_replicate` suggests that there's a specific lemma or property being invoked which directly addresses the condition under which a multiset is equal to a replicated sequence of an element `a`.\n\n2. **Application of the Condition**: The `exact` command is then used to apply the condition that is necessary and sufficient for the `s = replicate n a` equivalence to hold true. This condition, based on the `and_iff_right` function, implies that the right side of an \"and\" conjunction is given (or true by some prior condition, in this case, `s.2`, which might refer to a property or condition associated with `s`), and thus, the focus is on proving the left side, which in this context is the equivalence of `s` to a replicated sequence of `a`.\n\nIn essence, the proof shows that given any sequence `s`, it is equivalent to a sequence consisting of `n` repetitions of an element `a` if and only if every element within `s` is identical to `a`.

This is because the complement of everything in a given space is nothing, following the logic that removing all elements from the universal set leaves you with no elements.\n\nIn summary, the proof is a direct application of the `compl_top` principle to the specific context of finite sets, demonstrating the logical conclusion that the complement of the universal finite set of any type is the empty set.

This effectively formalizes the process of separately calculating the products after mapping `f` and `g` and then combining these products through multiplication.\n\nIn natural language, the proof demonstrates the principle that when you have a collection of items and you apply two operations to each item and then combine those items with a binary operation (like multiplication), it is equivalent to performing each operation over the entire collection separately and then combining the results with the same binary operation.

The identity element in this context is the empty sequence (or list).\n\nThe theorem `ofList_nil` asserts that when you take the \"ofList\" function, which constructs an element of the free monoid from a list of elements of type `\u03b1`, and apply it to the empty list `[]`, the result is the identity element of the free monoid, denoted by `1`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of the theorem is given by `rfl`, which stands for \"reflexivity\". In the context of Lean4 and similar theorem provers, `rfl` indicates that the statement can be proven by observing that both sides of the equation are exactly the same by definition.\n\nIn more detail, the proof strategy here is direct and follows from the definition of the `ofList` function for the free monoid. By the definition of `ofList`, when it is applied to an empty list `[]`, it must produce the monoid's identity element, because the identity element is the result of combining no elements together, which is exactly what an empty list represents. Thus, `ofList ([] : List \u03b1) = 1` simply reflects this fact and is true by the very construction of `ofList` and the identity element in the free monoid. The use of `rfl` signifies that there's no further logical deduction needed beyond understanding these definitions.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

This is straightforward because any number, including 1, raised to the power of a non-negative integer (including zero), remains unchanged. Mathematically, this is represented as \\(1^n = 1\\).

This is done in the following steps:\n\n1. **Assumption**: Assume that `toAddSubmonoid(p) = toAddSubmonoid(q)`. This means the function yields the same additive submonoid when applied to submodules `p` and `q`.\n\n2. **Goal**: To show that `p = q` as submodules. \n\n3. **Method**: The proof leverages the fact that a submodule is fully characterized by its underlying set of elements. Thus, proving `p = q` is equivalent to showing that the sets of elements that constitute `p` and `q` are identical.\n\n4. **Execution**: It utilizes the helper lemma `SetLike.ext'_iff`, which states that two set-like objects are equal if and only if their underlying sets are equal. This lemma is applied in two steps:\n   - First, it uses `SetLike.ext'_iff.1` to translate the assumption that `toAddSubmonoid(p) = toAddSubmonoid(q)` into an equality of their underlying sets: `(p.toAddSubmonoid : Set M) = (q.toAddSubmonoid : Set M)`.\n   - Then, it asserts that this equality of sets implies `p = q` through the converse implication of the same helper lemma (`SetLike.ext'_iff.2`), effectively showing that the original submodules `p` and `q` are identical because their underlying sets are identical.\n\nThus, the lemma demonstrates the injectivity of the `toAddSubmonoid` function by showing that if it maps two submodules to the same additive submonoid, those submodules must be the same, based on the uniqueness of their underlying sets.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

The theorem states that `p.toSubMulAction` is equal to `q.toSubMulAction` if and only if `p` is equal to `q`. This theorem is typically concerned with structures in mathematics or computer science where an object's identity can be determined by a specific action or property, in this case, `toSubMulAction`.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is succinctly given by `toSubMulAction_injective.eq_iff`. Here's what happens in this proof, broken down:\n\n1. **Understanding `toSubMulAction_injective`**: The term `toSubMulAction_injective` suggests that there is an injective function involved, specifically related to `toSubMulAction`. In mathematics, a function is injective (or one-to-one) if it maps distinct arguments to distinct results. In this context, it means that for any two objects `p` and `q`, if `p.toSubMulAction` equals `q.toSubMulAction`, then `p` must be equal to `q`. The injectiveness is crucial because it ensures that the mapping from objects to their `toSubMulAction` results does not collide for distinct objects.\n\n2. **Applying `.eq_iff`**: The `.eq_iff` part likely refers to a method or property that provides a logical equivalence (iff stands for \"if and only if\") between the equality of the `toSubMulAction` results and the objects themselves. Essentially, it formalizes the statement that if `p.toSubMulAction = q.toSubMulAction`, then `p = q`, and vice versa, respecting the injective property mentioned earlier.\n\n3. **Concluding the proof**: By relying on the injectiveness of the `toSubMulAction` mapping and stating the equivalence through `.eq_iff`, the proof establishes that the only way for `p.toSubMulAction` and `q.toSubMulAction` to be equal is for `p` and `q` themselves to be equal. This is a logical conclusion based on the properties of injective functions and the definition of equality in this context.\n\nIn summary, the proof leverages the injective property of a function related to `toSubMulAction` to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the equality of `p.toSubMulAction` and `q.toSubMulAction` and the equality of `p` and `q` themselves.

The statement can be generalized beyond multiplication to addition, indicating a broader principle of identity elements in algebraic structures.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof of this theorem is achieved through the application of a universal property (funext, short for function extensionality), which asserts that two functions are equal if they produce the same output for the same input across their entire domain. Specifically, it applies this principle to the function that multiplies elements by 1 (the identity element for multiplication in the structure M) and the identity function (id, which returns whatever input it is given without modification).\n\n1. **Universal Property (Function Extensionality)**: This principle is invoked to compare the function that multiplies elements by 1 to the identity function over the domain M.

Thus, the theorem is proven, affirming the role of the multiplicative identity.\n\nIn summary, the proof leverages the principle of function extensionality to demonstrate that the operation of multiplying by the multiplicative identity is equivalent to performing no operation at all (i.e., the identity function), across the entire structure M.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Here are the steps, translated from the Lean4 syntax into natural language:\n\n1. **Definition of Semiconjugacy:** Semiconjugacy, denoted `SemiconjBy a b c`, means `a * b = c * a`. It's a relation that says multiplying `a` by `b` on the left gives the same result as multiplying `c` by `a` on the right.\n\n2. **Inverse Operation:** The statement involves the inverses of the elements (`a\u207b\u00b9`, `x\u207b\u00b9`, `y\u207b\u00b9`).

Specifically, it employs the rule `\u2190 mul_inv_rev`, which translates to taking the inverse of a product, `(a*b)\u207b\u00b9 = b\u207b\u00b9 * a\u207b\u00b9`, thus transforming the semiconjugacy condition according to the inverses.\n\n4. **Injection and Commutation:** The statement `inv_inj` asserts that the function mapping an element to its inverse is injective, meaning distinct elements have distinct inverses. The equivalence is then established by showing this relationship holds in both directions (`eq_comm`), which involves commutativity of equality, essentially stating that if `a\u207b\u00b9 * x\u207b\u00b9 = y\u207b\u00b9 * a\u207b\u00b9`, then it implies `a * y = x * a`.\n\nThe proof concludes by demonstrating that these manipulations of the original semiconjugacy condition using group inverses and properties lead to the conclusion that `a\u207b\u00b9` semiconjugating `x\u207b\u00b9` and `y\u207b\u00b9` is indeed equivalent to `a` semiconjugating `y` and `x`.

Under this assumption, we can derive that the monoid must be a subsingleton. This is because, in a setting where 0 = 1, every element of the monoid must necessarily be identical (since any element multiplied by one, which is also zero, must give the element itself, but since one is zero, it implies every element must be zero). Thus, there can be at most one distinct element in the monoid, fulfilling the definition of a subsingleton.\n\n- **(From 2 to 1)** Assume the monoid is a subsingleton, meaning there is at most one unique element in the monoid. Given this assumption, any two elements of the monoid must be the same by definition. Specifically, this means that the distinct elements we usually consider in a monoid, zero and one, must actually be the same element. Therefore, under the subsingleton condition, 0 = 1.\n\nIn summary, the theorem establishes a direct relationship between the structural property of the monoid (being a subsingleton or not) and the equality of its zero and one elements.

This is based on the definition of a unit, which requires an element to have a multiplicative inverse.\n   - The proof then uses a property `zero_mul` which implies that the multiplication of zero with any element yields zero (`0 * a = 0`). \n   - Comparing this with the assumption `0 * a = 1`, it follows, under the constraints of the structure, that `0 = 1`. This conclusion relies on the uniqueness of such an element `a` that contradicts the typical property of multiplication by zero, leading to the inference that the structure must define zero and one as equivalent.\n\n2. **(\u2190 Direction):** If zero equals one, then zero is a unit.\n\n   - The premise here is that zero equals one (`0 = 1`). From this assumption, a broader mathematical property is derived\u2014specifically, that the structure `M\u2080` is a \"subsingleton\".

This means that parts of the function `transAssocReparamAux` are already known to be continuous based on previous knowledge or theorems.\n\n4. **Handling Different Cases**: The proof uses a combination of `continuity` and `skip` commands to handle different cases or parts of the function. The `continuity` command asserts the continuity of certain parts, while `skip` is likely used to bypass parts that don't need explicit proof of continuity or are trivial.\n\n5. **Detailing the Proof**: The proof includes an introductory part (`\u00b7 intro x hx`) where a specific setting or scenario is introduced for the function. This is followed by setting certain options (`set_option tactic.skipAssignedInstances false`) and performing numerical normalization (`norm_num [hx]`). This part of the proof deals with specific values or instances within the theorem and manipulates them to align with the continuity argument.\n\nOverall, the proof is a technical demonstration of the continuity of a specific function, leveraging known continuities and logical constructs in Lean4's proof language.

This is based on the inducing property of `f`, which ensures that certain topological properties, such as continuity, are preserved under the function.\n\n3. **Key Components of the Proof**:\n    - `\u27e8rfl\u27e9`: This part essentially states that the topology on `M\u2081` is defined exactly as the induced topology from `u` through `f`, without any modifications.\n    - `continuous_id`: It references the continuity of the identity function within the topological space of `M\u2081`. The identity function is trivially continuous, mapping each element to itself.\n    - `map_smul f _ _`: This signifies the mapping of scalar multiplication through the function `f`, maintaining the continuity of this operation in the induced topology scenario.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: By combining the induction of topology through `f`, the inherent continuity of scalar multiplication in the module `M\u2081`, and the preservation of this continuity under the induced topology, the proof concludes that scalar multiplication remains continuous in the topological module `M\u2081` with the topology induced by `f`.\n\nThis logical narrative adheres to the syntax and reasoning presented in the Lean4 code, demonstrating how formal verification tools like Lean4 translate mathematical statements and proofs into a structured, machine-checkable format.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",

Finiteness is a crucial property in many mathematical contexts, often implying boundedness or manageability in some sense.\n\n5. **Complement in cofinite set**: The proof concludes with `.compl_mem_cofinite`, which suggests that the complement of the singleton set `{x}` within some larger set (presumably the entire space `\u03b1`) is in the cofinite set. Cofinite sets are those whose complements have a finite number of elements. Therefore, this step demonstrates that the condition for boundedness is met by showing that the set's complement is appropriately restricted (in this case, by being cofinite).\n\n6. **Final conclusion**: The combination of these steps logically leads to the conclusion that the singleton set `{x}` is bounded according to the specific definition of boundedness used in this context. The exact nature of this boundedness (e.g., in terms of size, distance, or another measure) is dependent on the broader mathematical framework but is not detailed in the snippet provided.\n\nIn natural language, this proof demonstrates that any set containing exactly one element (`{x}`) satisfies the criteria to be considered bounded within the given mathematical framework.

The proof strategy involves simplifying the expression by applying the definitions and known truths directly relevant to this function and the context (like properties of equality and conditional statements).\n3. The simplification process leverages the facts that: the function `quadraticCharFun` when evaluated under certain conditions (like input `0` in this case) must inherently equal `0` by its definition or the properties it adheres to; `eq_self_iff_true` which is a principle stating that an expression is equal to itself if and only if it's true, contributing to the simplification by eliminating unnecessary complexity; and `if_true` and `id.def` which likely refer to simplifying conditionals and identity functions within the context of this proof.\n4.

In the context of a simple graph, being injective means that if we have two instances where `Adj` yields the same result (true for adjacency or false for non-adjacency), then the inputs (the graph and the pair of vertices) for these two instances must be the same.\n\n# Proof:\nThe proof uses the `SimpleGraph.ext` extensionality principle for simple graphs. This principle states that to prove two simple graphs are equal, it is sufficient to show that for any given pair of vertices, the adjacency relation (whether two vertices are connected by an edge) is the same in both graphs.\n\nHere, `SimpleGraph.ext` is applied to the adjacency function `Adj` to establish its injectivity. The reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. Assume we have two instances of the `Adj` function that produce the same output (either true for adjacent or false for non-adjacent) for the same pair of vertices in potentially different graphs.\n2. By the definition of injectivity, we need to show that the inputs (the graphs and the pair of vertices) are indeed the same.\n3. The application of `SimpleGraph.ext` implicitly does this by ensuring that for any pair of vertices, their adjacency status in both instances (graphs) must be identical for the theorem to hold.\n4. Since `SimpleGraph.ext` requires that the adjacency relation is preserved across the graphs for all vertex pairs, it follows that the only way for `Adj` to be injective (i.e., produce the same result from potentially different inputs) is if the inputs are actually not different\u2014meaning the two instances of the graph must be the same, as well as the pairs of vertices.\n5. Thus, the injectivity of `Adj` is established, demonstrating that for the function to yield the same result, the inputs must be identical, affirming the initial claim of the theorem.\n\nThis proof hinges on the principle of extensionality within the context of simple graphs, leveraging the fact that graph equality can be determined by examining the adjacency relations between their vertices.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to Lean: ",
