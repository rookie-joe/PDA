        "nl_proof": "The total length of Bonnie's wire is $12\\cdot6=72$ inches, while her total volume is $6^3=216$ cubic inches. Each of Roark's unit cubes has volume $1$ cubic inch, so he needs $216$ cubes.\n\nSince each cube has $12$ edges, each of Roark's cubes has $12\\cdot1=12$ inches of wire. So his $216$ cubes have a total of $216\\cdot12$ inches of wire.\n\nSo the desired fraction is $\\dfrac{72}{216\\cdot12}=\\dfrac{6}{216}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{36}}$.\nThe answer is \\dfrac{1}{36}\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to lean4:",

When we take the pushforward of this sigma-algebra through the function `f`, we are essentially mapping each subset of `α` to its image under `f`.\n3. Since the original sigma-algebra contained all possible subsets, the resulting collection of sets after applying `f` must also contain all possible subsets of the codomain of `f`.\n4. This resulting collection of sets, being the image of a sigma-algebra under `f`, will also satisfy the properties of a sigma-algebra.\n5. Now, we have a sigma-algebra on the codomain of `f` that contains all possible subsets of the codomain. This means it must be the largest sigma-algebra on the codomain.\n6. Therefore, the pushforward of the largest sigma-algebra on `α` through `f` is equal to the largest sigma-algebra on the codomain of `f`.\n\nThe proof leverages the properties of the largest sigma-algebra, the definition of the pushforward operation, and likely utilizes a theorem connecting `gc`, `comap`, and `map` to establish the desired equality.

If a set has a premeasure of 0, it means that it doesn't intersect with the support of `p` (because the support only includes sets with non-zero premeasure).\n5.
