For any point 'y' in our set, we consider the Dirac measure centered at 'y'.\n4. **Carath\u00e9odory Property:** Due to the Carath\u00e9odory construction, we know that our outer measure of any set is less than or equal to the sum of its values on two sets that \"split\" the original set in a specific way.\n5. **Combining Inequalities:** We combine the fact that the Dirac measure is less than or equal to the Carath\u00e9odory outer measure (by definition of Dirac) and the Carath\u00e9odory property. This allows us to relate the Carath\u00e9odory outer measure to the value assigned by any other outer measure.\n6. **Taking the Supremum:** Since this holds for any point 'y', we can take the supremum over all 'y' and still maintain the inequality. This establishes that the Carath\u00e9odory outer measure is greater than or equal to the other outer measure for any arbitrary set.\n7. **Conclusion:** As this holds for any arbitrary outer measure, we conclude that the Carath\u00e9odory outer measure is the top element, assigning infinite measure to every set.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to lean4:",

When we take the pushforward of this sigma-algebra through the function `f`, we are essentially mapping each subset of `\u03b1` to its image under `f`.\n3. Since the original sigma-algebra contained all possible subsets, the resulting collection of sets after applying `f` must also contain all possible subsets of the codomain of `f`.\n4. This resulting collection of sets, being the image of a sigma-algebra under `f`, will also satisfy the properties of a sigma-algebra.\n5. Now, we have a sigma-algebra on the codomain of `f` that contains all possible subsets of the codomain. This means it must be the largest sigma-algebra on the codomain.\n6. Therefore, the pushforward of the largest sigma-algebra on `\u03b1` through `f` is equal to the largest sigma-algebra on the codomain of `f`.\n\nThe proof leverages the properties of the largest sigma-algebra, the definition of the pushforward operation, and likely utilizes a theorem connecting `gc`, `comap`, and `map` to establish the desired equality.

When we convert this finite set `s` into a regular set, we simply remove the restriction of having a limited number of elements. \n4. However, the resulting set still contains all the elements from the original finite set `s` and no new elements are added.\n5. Since the original set `s` had a finite number of elements, the converted regular set also has at most the same finite number of elements.\n6. Any set with a finite number of elements is considered countable because we can assign a unique natural number to each element.\n7. Therefore, the conversion of a finite set into a regular set results in a countable set.\n\nTranslate the statement and proof in natural language to lean4:",

This tells us that the set of points where \\( f + g \\) differs from \\( f \\) is the same as the support of \\( g \\): `g.support`.\n4.
