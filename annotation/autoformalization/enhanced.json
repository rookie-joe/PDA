We know that `p.toOuterMeasure_apply_singleton x` represents the probability assigned to `x` by `p`, and similarly for `q`.\n4. From our initial assumption (`toOuterMeasure p = toOuterMeasure q`) and applying both outer measures to the singleton set `{x}`, we get: `(toOuterMeasure p) {x} = (toOuterMeasure q) {x}`.\n5. Using the lemma `toOuterMeasure_apply_singleton x`, we can rewrite this as: `p.toOuterMeasure_apply_singleton x = q.toOuterMeasure_apply_singleton x`.\n6. This shows that `p` and `q` assign the same probability to an arbitrary element `x`.\n7. Since `x` was arbitrary, we can conclude that `p` and `q` assign the same probability to all elements.\n8.
